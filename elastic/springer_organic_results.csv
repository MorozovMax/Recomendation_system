Hypothesis-Driven Virtual Experiments: A Neuroinformatics Primer,/article/10.1134/S1995080223010250,"The paper demonstrates a new way of decomposing complex multidisciplinary problems using a platform for supporting the execution hypothesis-driven virtual experiments. The approach is based on combining methods and tools from several domains to support hypothesis-driven, data-intensive research. A primer shows all steps from virtual experiment life cycle from its specification till execution. Platform enables to store virtual experiments, its metadata and other core artifacts, analyze dependencies between hypotheses/models, abandon certain workflow routes, plan experiment execution, compare models, range hypotheses and generate models from data if required. Demonstration is carried out with the problem of identifying differences in functional dependencies for men and women and for young and middle-aged adults which comes from neuroinformatics domain.",D.

"Farewell, Neuroinformatics!",/article/10.1007/s12021-021-09552-5,"It is with a bittersweet feeling that we pen one last Editorial after almost exactly two decades since founding this journal. The original publisher of Neuroinformatics was Humana Press, a small (for today’s standards, at least) and back then independent publishing company best known at that time for its Methods in Molecular Biology book series. Humana’s president, Thomas Lanigan Sr., together with his energetic aid Elyse O’Grady, had a distinct knack for predicting the emergence of new fields in biomedical research and ran a professional yet personable, family-style operation (the first marketing director of Neuroinformatics was Lanigan’s son, Tom Jr.). We finalized the aims of the journal in the fall of 2001, endeavoring to provide a forum that would emphasize data analysis, integration, engineering, and sharing in all areas of neuroscience research.Footnote 1 Submissions began to arrive in April of the following year, and the inaugural issue appeared at the 2002 Society for Neuroscience Meeting. Since then, we action edited over 1500 initial manuscripts and eventually accepted for publication approximately half of them, the vast majority describing original research.","Giorgio A.

A Standards Organization for Open and FAIR Neuroscience: the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility,/article/10.1007/s12021-020-09509-0,"There is great need for coordination around standards and best practices in neuroscience to support efforts to make neuroscience a data-centric discipline. Major brain initiatives launched around the world are poised to generate huge stores of neuroscience data. At the same time, neuroscience, like many domains in biomedicine, is confronting the issues of transparency, rigor, and reproducibility. Widely used, validated standards and best practices are key to addressing the challenges in both big and small data science, as they are essential for integrating diverse data and for developing a robust, effective, and sustainable infrastructure to support open and reproducible neuroscience. However, developing community standards and gaining their adoption is difficult. The current landscape is characterized both by a lack of robust, validated standards and a plethora of overlapping, underdeveloped, untested and underutilized standards and best practices. The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), an independent organization dedicated to promoting data sharing through the coordination of infrastructure and standards, has recently implemented a formal procedure for evaluating and endorsing community standards and best practices in support of the FAIR principles. By formally serving as a standards organization dedicated to open and FAIR neuroscience, INCF helps evaluate, promulgate, and coordinate standards and best practices across neuroscience. Here, we provide an overview of the process and discuss how neuroscience can benefit from having a dedicated standards body.","Mathew Birdsall Abrams, Jan G. Bjaalie, ... Maryann E.

Neuroinformatics in the Time of Coronavirus,/article/10.1007/s12021-020-09478-4,"Some years ago, I received an inquiry from an international PhD student from the lab of a known electrophysiologist.Footnote 1 She had secured a fellowship that allowed her to spend time in another lab during her doctoral training and she wanted to come to my lab to learn the neuroinformatics trade. I interviewed her in person at the Society for Neuroscience meeting a few weeks later and asked her why, after investing half a decade mastering advanced skills in patch clamp and intraneuronal recordings, she wanted to jump into neuroinformatics. She was adamant in saying that she saw a shrinking market for experimental research, at least in relative terms, and a growing role for data science. She also thought it would become increasingly difficult, on economic, social, and personnel counts, to eventually create and maintain a wet lab centered on animal research, and to keep it productive. Just as many discoveries awaited, she felt, in big data, informatics, computer analytics, and modeling – and that sounded to her like a wiser and more appealing career prospect.",Giorgio A.

Assessing the ethical and social concerns of artificial intelligence in neuroinformatics research: an empirical test of the European Union Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI),/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00201-4,"Ethical and social concerns are a key obstacle to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the life sciences and beyond. The discussion of these issues has intensified in recent years and led to a number of approaches, tools and initiatives. Key amongst them is the idea of ex-ante impact assessments that aim to identify issues at the early stages of development. One prominent example of such ex-ante impact assessment is the European Union's (EU) Assessment list for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI). This article uses the findings of a large-scale application of the ALTAI to a large neuro-informatics project as an exemplar to demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the ALTAI in practice. The article shows that ex-ante impact assessment has the potential to help identify and address ethical and social issues. However, they need to be understood as part of a broader socio-technical ecosystem of AI. For ALTAI and related approaches to be useful in bio-medical research, they should be interpreted from a systems theory perspective which allows for their integration into the rich set of tools, legislation and approaches. The paper argues that ex-ante impact assessments have the best chance of being successful if seen applied in conjunction with other approaches in the context of the overall AI ecosystem.","Bernd Carsten Stahl, Tonii Leach",2022-09-19
Gradients of Brain Organization: Smooth Sailing from Methods Development to User Community,/article/10.1007/s12021-024-09660-y,"Multimodal neuroimaging grants a powerful in vivo window into the structure and function of the human brain. Recent methodological and conceptual advances have enabled investigations of the interplay between large-scale spatial trends – or gradients – in brain structure and function, offering a framework to unify principles of brain organization across multiple scales. Strong community enthusiasm for these techniques has been instrumental in their widespread adoption and implementation to answer key questions in neuroscience. Following a brief review of current literature on this framework, this perspective paper will highlight how pragmatic steps aiming to make gradient methods more accessible to the community propelled these techniques to the forefront of neuroscientific inquiry. More specifically, we will emphasize how interest for gradient methods was catalyzed by data sharing, open-source software development, as well as the organization of dedicated workshops led by a diverse team of early career researchers. To this end, we argue that the growing excitement for brain gradients is the result of coordinated and consistent efforts to build an inclusive community and can serve as a case in point for future innovations and conceptual advances in neuroinformatics. We close this perspective paper by discussing challenges for the continuous refinement of neuroscientific theory, methodological innovation, and real-world translation to maintain our collective progress towards integrated models of brain organization.","Jessica Royer, Casey Paquola, ...

Computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics: Recent progress and resources,/article/10.1007/s12038-018-9813-y,"The human brain and its temporal behavior correlated with development, structure, and function is a complex natural system even for its own kind. Coding and automation are necessary for modeling, analyzing and understanding the 86.1 ± 8.1 billion neurons, an almost equal number of non-neuronal glial cells, and the neuronal networks of the human brain comprising about 100 trillion connections. ‘Computational neuroscience’ which is heavily dependent on biology, physics, mathematics and computation addresses such problems while the archival, retrieval and merging of the huge amount of generated data in the form of clinical records, scientific literature, and specialized databases are carried out by ‘neuroinformatics’ approaches. Neuroinformatics is thus an interface between computer science and experimental neuroscience. This article provides an introduction to computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields along with their state-of-the-art tools, software, and resources. Furthermore, it describes a few innovative applications of these fields in predicting and detecting brain network organization, complex brain disorder diagnosis, large-scale 3D simulation of the brain, brain–computer, and brain-to-brain interfaces. It provides an integrated overview of the fields in a non-technical way, appropriate for broad general readership.

Kinetic–Statistical Neuromodeling and Problems of Trust in Artificial Intelligence Systems,/article/10.1134/S105261882307004X,"The focus of this article is related to cognitive sciences: the problems of modeling neural networks and consciousness in general are discussed. Examples of the inadequacy of artificial intelligence systems based on neural network modeling are given, and problems of the modern numerical model of neural networks are considered. In order to solve these problems, the methodology of consciousness neuromodeling based on kinetic-statistical methods is proposed. It is shown that, in the process of quasi-chaotic complication of the neuro-like graph during the percolation transition, large structures (clusters) are formed, which can be interpreted as a manifestation of the primary elements of consciousness. The manifestation of the phenomenon of self-consciousness in the process of complication of the system of neural clusters is discussed.

A paired dataset of T1- and T2-weighted MRI at 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla,/article/10.1038/s41597-023-02400-y,"Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft tissue contrasts that are critical for disease diagnosis and neuroscience research. Higher MRI resolution typically comes at the cost of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast, particularly for more common 3 Tesla (3T) MRI scanners. At ultra-high magnetic field strength, 7 Tesla (7T) MRI allows for higher resolution with greater tissue contrast and SNR. However, the prohibitively high costs of 7T MRI scanners deter their widespread adoption in clinical and research centers. To obtain higher-quality images without 7T MRI scanners, algorithms that can synthesize 7T MR images from 3T MR images are under active development. Here, we make available a dataset of paired T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images at 3T and 7T of 10 healthy subjects to facilitate the development and evaluation of 3T-to-7T MR image synthesis models.

An Automated Tool to Classify and Transform Unstructured MRI Data into BIDS Datasets,/article/10.1007/s12021-024-09659-5,"The increasing use of neuroimaging in clinical research has driven the creation of many large imaging datasets. However, these datasets often rely on inconsistent naming conventions in image file headers to describe acquisition, and time-consuming manual curation is necessary. Therefore, we sought to automate the process of classifying and organizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data according to acquisition types common to the clinical routine, as well as automate the transformation of raw, unstructured images into Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) datasets. To do this, we trained an XGBoost model to classify MRI acquisition types using relatively few acquisition parameters that are automatically stored by the MRI scanner in image file metadata, which are then mapped to the naming conventions prescribed by BIDS to transform the input images to the BIDS structure. The model recognizes MRI types with 99.475% accuracy, as well as a micro/macro-averaged precision of 0.9995/0.994, a micro/macro-averaged recall of 0.9995/0.989, and a micro/macro-averaged F1 of 0.9995/0.991.

Characterizing the profiles of patients with acute concussion versus prolonged post-concussion symptoms in Ontario,/article/10.1038/s41598-023-44095-6,"Identifying vulnerability factors for developing persisting concussion symptoms is imperative for determining which patients may require specialized treatment. Using cross-sectional questionnaire data from an Ontario-wide observational concussion study, we compared patients with acute concussion (≤ 14 days) and prolonged post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) (≥ 90 days) on four factors of interest: sex, history of mental health disorders, history of headaches/migraines, and past concussions. Differences in profile between the two groups were also explored. 110 patients with acute concussion and 96 patients with PPCS were included in our study. The groups did not differ on the four factors of interest. Interestingly, both groups had greater proportions of females (acute concussion: 61.1% F; PPCS: 66.3% F). Patient profiles, however, differed wherein patients with PPCS were significantly older, more symptomatic, more likely to have been injured in a transportation-related incident, and more likely to live outside a Metropolitan city. These novel risk factors for persisting concussion symptoms require replication and highlight the need to re-evaluate previously identified risk factors as more and more concussions occur in non-athletes and different risk factors may be at play.","Olivia F.

Towards Robust Physical Human Robot Interaction by an Adaptive Admittance Controller,/article/10.1007/s10846-023-01999-9,"The regular admittance controller cannot be easily transferred to the physical human–robot interaction scenario because of the dynamic stiffness of the human arm. The dynamic interaction of humans can cause high frequency and unsafe oscillation of the robot arm. Based on the adaptive control scheme, this paper presents an online sensory-based analytical approach to recognize and quantify the “stability index"" named as a robust haptic observer. The observer performs the Fast Fourier Transform on the interaction force signal within a sliding window and quickly detects system oscillation through a simple mathematical transformation. Compared with the existing methods, it can calculate a normalized system stability index more accurately and faster. This quantified index is employed in a linearized adaptive law to tune the parameters of the admittance controller. Experimental validation of the proposed strategy is performed and compared with state-of-the-art work in a task of human-guided drawing. The results show that our proposed approach can effectively detect oscillation, and the drawing time is shortened by 15% with the same tracking accuracy.

nGauge: Integrated and Extensible Neuron Morphology Analysis in Python,/article/10.1007/s12021-022-09573-8,"The study of neuron morphology requires robust and comprehensive methods to quantify the differences between neurons of different subtypes and animal species. Several software packages have been developed for the analysis of neuron tracing results stored in the standard SWC format. The packages, however, provide relatively simple quantifications and their non-extendable architecture prohibit their use for advanced data analysis and visualization. We developed nGauge, a Python toolkit to support the parsing and analysis of neuron morphology data. As an application programming interface (API), nGauge can be referenced by other popular open-source software to create custom informatics analysis pipelines and advanced visualizations. nGauge defines an extendable data structure that handles volumetric constructions (e.g. soma), in addition to the SWC linear reconstructions, while remaining lightweight. This greatly extends nGauge’s data compatibility.","Logan A. Walker, Jennifer S. Williams, ... Dawen Cai",2022-03-05
Serum biomarkers identify critically ill traumatic brain injury patients for MRI,/article/10.1186/s13054-022-04250-3,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carries prognostic importance after traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially when computed tomography (CT) fails to fully explain the level of unconsciousness. However, in critically ill patients, the risk of deterioration during transfer needs to be balanced against the benefit of detecting prognostically relevant information on MRI. We therefore aimed to assess if day of injury serum protein biomarkers could identify critically ill TBI patients in whom the risks of transfer are compensated by the likelihood of detecting management-altering neuroimaging findings.","Sophie Richter, Stefan Winzeck, ...

Functionally Logical Modeling of the Σπ-Neuron,/article/10.1007/s10958-021-05247-z,"In this paper, we suggest a circuitry method of the realization of a logical ΣΠ-neuron. We present digital and hybrid schemes of the logical ΣΠ-neuron. Each scheme is divided into two layers, which realize the multiplicative and additive operations, respectively. The schemes are constructed on the basis of digital and analogue elements. The layer performing the multiplicative function is identical in both schemes. The additive layer in the digital scheme is realized by the digital summator. In the hybrid scheme, it is realized by digital-to-analogue converters and the analogue summator of voltages. To realize the threshold function, the hybrid scheme uses a comparator and the digital one uses a digital comparator. The results obtained can be used for the construction of ΣΠ-neural networks.",M.

Machine Learning for Brain Imaging Genomics Methods: A Review,/article/10.1007/s11633-022-1361-0,"In the past decade, multimodal neuroimaging and genomic techniques have been increasingly developed. As an interdisciplinary topic, brain imaging genomics is devoted to evaluating and characterizing genetic variants in individuals that influence phenotypic measures derived from structural and functional brain imaging. This technique is capable of revealing the complex mechanisms by macroscopic intermediates from the genetic level to cognition and psychiatric disorders in humans. It is well known that machine learning is a powerful tool in the data-driven association studies, which can fully utilize priori knowledge (intercorrelated structure information among imaging and genetic data) for association modelling. In addition, the association study is able to find the association between risk genes and brain structure or function so that a better mechanistic understanding of behaviors or disordered brain functions is explored. In this paper, the related background and fundamental work in imaging genomics are first reviewed. Then, we show the univariate learning approaches for association analysis, summarize the main idea and modelling in genetic-imaging association studies based on multivariate machine learning, and present methods for joint association analysis and outcome prediction. Finally, this paper discusses some prospects for future work.","Mei-Ling Wang, Wei Shao, ... Dao-Qiang Zhang",2023-01-10
An open relaxation-diffusion MRI dataset in neurosurgical studies,/article/10.1038/s41597-024-03013-9,"Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a safe and noninvasive technique that provides insight into the microarchitecture of brain tissue. Relaxation-diffusion MRI (rdMRI) is an extension of traditional dMRI that captures diffusion imaging data at multiple TEs to detect tissue heterogeneity between relaxation and diffusivity. rdMRI has great potential in neurosurgical research including brain tumor grading and treatment response evaluation. However, the lack of available data has limited the exploration of rdMRI in clinical settings. To address this, we are sharing a high-quality rdMRI dataset from 18 neurosurgical patients with different types of lesions, as well as two healthy individuals as controls. The rdMRI data was acquired using 7 TEs, where at each TE multi-shell dMRI with high spatial and angular resolutions is obtained at each TE. Each rdMRI scan underwent thorough artifact and distortion corrections using a specially designed processing pipeline. The dataset’s quality was assessed using standard practices, including quality control and assurance. This resource is a valuable addition to neurosurgical studies, and all data are openly accessible.","Ye Wu, Xiaoming Liu, ... Fan Zhang",2024-02-07
Characterizing functional modules in the human thalamus: coactivation-based parcellation and systems-level functional decoding,/article/10.1007/s00429-022-02603-w,"The human thalamus relays sensory signals to the cortex and facilitates brain-wide communication. The thalamus is also more directly involved in sensorimotor and various cognitive functions but a full characterization of its functional repertoire, particularly in regard to its internal anatomical structure, is still outstanding. As a putative hub in the human connectome, the thalamus might reveal its functional profile only in conjunction with interconnected brain areas. We therefore developed a novel systems-level Bayesian reverse inference decoding that complements the traditional neuroinformatics approach towards a network account of thalamic function. The systems-level decoding considers the functional repertoire (i.e., the terms associated with a brain region) of all regions showing co-activations with a predefined seed region in a brain-wide fashion. Here, we used task-constrained meta-analytic connectivity-based parcellation (MACM-CBP) to identify thalamic subregions as seed regions and applied the systems-level decoding to these subregions in conjunction with functionally connected cortical regions. Our results confirm thalamic structure–function relationships known from animal and clinical studies and revealed further associations with language, memory, and locomotion that have not been detailed in the cognitive neuroscience literature before. The systems-level decoding further uncovered large systems engaged in autobiographical memory and nociception. We propose this novel decoding approach as a useful tool to detect previously unknown structure–function relationships at the brain network level, and to build viable starting points for future studies.","Ole J.

For real-time fMRI, we compared models of positive social emotion regulation based on a network involving the bilateral amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal, and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. The top-down regulation model implied modulation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex exerted onto other regions, while the bottom-up model implied the inverse modulation. The validity of model calculations was tested using the data from three healthy volunteers who imagined positive interactions with people in presented photos (stimuli). We confirmed the dominance of the top-down model and evaluated the number and duration of iterations required for model estimations. The study shows the applicability of the four-node effective connectivity models for regulation of positive social emotions using real-time fMRI, e.g., for neurofeedback applications.","D. D.

Neural Decoding of Visual Information Across Different Neural Recording Modalities and Approaches,/article/10.1007/s11633-022-1335-2,"Vision plays a peculiar role in intelligence. Visual information, forming a large part of the sensory information, is fed into the human brain to formulate various types of cognition and behaviours that make humans become intelligent agents. Recent advances have led to the development of brain-inspired algorithms and models for machine vision. One of the key components of these methods is the utilization of the computational principles underlying biological neurons. Additionally, advanced experimental neuroscience techniques have generated different types of neural signals that carry essential visual information. Thus, there is a high demand for mapping out functional models for reading out visual information from neural signals. Here, we briefly review recent progress on this issue with a focus on how machine learning techniques can help in the development of models for contending various types of neural signals, from fine-scale neural spikes and single-cell calcium imaging to coarse-scale electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging recordings of brain signals.","Yi-Jun Zhang, Zhao-Fei Yu, ...

"In memoriam—Stephen Hugh Koslow, Ph.D",/article/10.1038/s41386-021-01049-8,"Stephen H. Koslow, ACNP Fellow Emeritus and member since 1977, unexpectedly lost his life on April 23, 2021. He had a most illustrious career and leaves an unusually large number of close colleagues and friends with whom he maintained close connections. Steve or “Koz” as he was known to many of us received his undergraduate education at Columbia University (BS) and his Ph.D in Pharmacology from the University of Chicago. After a postdoctoral fellowship at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, he joined the intramural research program in the Laboratory of Preclinical Pharmacology and subsequently became the chief of the Unit of Neurobiological Applications of Mass Spectrometry in that group. This program based at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital was a hotbed of neuroscience and biological psychiatry research. It was there that Steve began his work as the principal investigator of the Clinical Research Branch Collaborative Program on the Psychobiology of Depression, a 6 center study, a 10-year program. During this time he transitioned to the extramural NIMH, first as the Chief of the Biological Research Section in the Clinical Research Branch and subsequently as the Founding Branch Chief of the Neuroscience Research Branch. He kept rising in the extramural NIMH program to hold positions as Deputy Director of the Division of Basic Brain and Behavioral Research to Director of the Division of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience to finally serving as the Founding Director of the Office of Neuroinformatics. All together he served the NIMH from 1970 to 2004. After leaving NIMH he was affiliated with the Allen Institute for Brain Research, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and the Brain Research Corporation, based in Australia. In recent years, he served as a consultant to several academic departments, mentoring junior faculty in grantsmanship and scientific writing. This included a stint working with one of us (CBN) at the University of Miami. Steve had a very, very sharp mind and held himself and all around him to the highest scientific standards. He had little patience for sloppy work or sloppy thinking. He published peer-reviewed publications in the very best journals in our field including Science, Molecular Psychiatry, Neuropsychopharmacology, Human Brain Mapping, and Archives of General Psychiatry (now JAMA Psychiatry) the American Journal of Psychiatry. What was most impressive about Steve as a scientist was his thirst for new knowledge and new technologies that could be applied to clinical medicine.","Charles B. Nemeroff, Alan Frazer",2021-06-07

In general, the aim of qMRI is to characterize brain microstructure by quantifying the physical MR parameters of the tissue via computational, biophysical models. By proposing this new standard, we envision standardization of qMRI through multicenter dissemination of interoperable datasets. This way, BIDS can act as a catalyst of convergence between qMRI methods development and application-driven neuroimaging studies that can help develop quantitative biomarkers for neural tissue characterization. In conclusion, this BIDS extension offers a common ground for developers to exchange novel imaging data and tools, reducing the entrance barrier for qMRI in the field of neuroimaging.","Agah Karakuzu, Stefan Appelhoff, ...

 Research on the topic has sprung up like bamboo shoots. Neurodynamics is more often called computational neuroscience in Europe and the United States, and it is named neuromechanics in Japan (Takeda 1999). Neuroscientists in experimental fields prefer the term neuroinformatics’ to describe the basic law of neural information processing qualitatively or quantitatively (Ascoli 2016; Schutter 2016; Raichle and Gusnard 2002). But no matter what name we use, the basic fact remains that neuroscientists and scientists and engineers in the field of artificial intelligence have realized that the development of cognitive neuroscience not only depends on the progress of experimental techniques and data more and more, but also needs to understand and mine underlying principles of dynamical signal processing and transmission in brain networks and the internal mechanism of neural coding distribution mode. The laws and essences behind the vast amount of experimental data, enable us to understand and master the brain's operational methods and the pathogenesis of various brain diseases.

The emission wavelength of the CDs could be tuned spanning the full visible region by virtue of aggregation-induced narrowing of bandgaps. This tunable emission wavelength of the specific concentration response to diverse microbes can be used to distinguish microorganisms with a similar appearance, even in a same genus. A hyperspectral microscopy system was demonstrated to distinguish Aspergillus flavus and A. fumigatus based on the results above. The identification accuracy of the two similar-looking pathogens can be close to 100%, and the relative proportions and spatial distributions can also be profiled from the mixture of the pathogens. This technique can provide a solution to the fast detection of microorganisms and is potentially applicable to a wide range of problems in areas such as healthcare, food preparation, biotechnology, and health emergency.","Yongqiang Zhang, Kunxing Liu, ...

Discovery of the mechanisms of acupuncture in the treatment of migraine based on functional magnetic resonance imaging and omics,/article/10.1007/s11684-023-0989-7,"Migraine is one of the most prevalent and disabling neurological disease, but the current pharmacotherapies show limited efficacy and often accompanied by adverse effects. Acupuncture is a promising complementary therapy, but further clinical evidence is needed. The influence of acupuncture on migraine is not an immediate effect, and its mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to provide further clinical evidence for the anti-migraine effects of acupuncture and explore the mechanism involved. A randomized controlled trial was performed among 10 normal controls and 38 migraineurs. The migraineurs were divided into blank control, sham acupuncture, and acupuncture groups. Patients were subjected to two courses of treatment, and each treatment lasted for 5 days, with an interval of 1 day between the two courses. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated using pain questionnaire. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were analyzed for investigating brain changes induced by treatments. Blood plasma was collected for metabolomics and proteomics studies. Correlation and mediation analyses were performed to investigate the interaction between clinical, fMRI and omics changes. Results showed that acupuncture effectively relieved migraine symptoms in a way different from sham acupuncture in terms of curative effect, affected brain regions, and signaling pathways. The anti-migraine mechanism involves a complex network related to the regulation of the response to hypoxic stress, reversal of brain energy imbalance, and regulation of inflammation. The brain regions of migraineurs affected by acupuncture include the lingual gyrus, default mode network, and cerebellum. The effect of acupuncture on patients’ metabolites/proteins may precede that of the brain.","Chong Li, Xinyi Li, ... Guihua Tian",2023-06-30
Assisted neuroscience knowledge extraction via machine learning applied to neural reconstruction metadata on NeuroMorpho.Org,/article/10.1186/s40708-022-00174-4,"The amount of unstructured text produced daily in scholarly journals is enormous. Systematically identifying, sorting, and structuring information from such a volume of data is increasingly challenging for researchers even in delimited domains. Named entity recognition is a fundamental natural language processing tool that can be trained to annotate, structure, and extract information from scientific articles. Here, we harness state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and develop a smart neuroscience metadata suggestion system accessible by both humans through a user-friendly graphical interface and machines via Application Programming Interface. We demonstrate a practical application to the public repository of neural reconstructions, NeuroMorpho.Org, thus expanding the existing web-based metadata management system currently in use. Quantitative analysis indicates that the suggestion system reduces personnel labor by at least 50%. Moreover, our results show that larger training datasets with the same software architecture are unlikely to further improve performance without ad-hoc heuristics due to intrinsic ambiguities in neuroscience nomenclature.

Behavioural relevance of redundant and synergistic stimulus information between functionally connected neurons in mouse auditory cortex,/article/10.1186/s40708-023-00212-9,"Measures of functional connectivity have played a central role in advancing our understanding of how information is transmitted and processed within the brain. Traditionally, these studies have focused on identifying redundant functional connectivity, which involves determining when activity is similar across different sites or neurons. However, recent research has highlighted the importance of also identifying synergistic connectivity—that is, connectivity that gives rise to information not contained in either site or neuron alone. Here, we measured redundant and synergistic functional connectivity between neurons in the mouse primary auditory cortex during a sound discrimination task. Specifically, we measured directed functional connectivity between neurons simultaneously recorded with calcium imaging. We used Granger Causality as a functional connectivity measure. We then used Partial Information Decomposition to quantify the amount of redundant and synergistic information about the presented sound that is carried by functionally connected or functionally unconnected pairs of neurons. We found that functionally connected pairs present proportionally more redundant information and proportionally less synergistic information about sound than unconnected pairs, suggesting that their functional connectivity is primarily redundant. Further, synergy and redundancy coexisted both when mice made correct or incorrect perceptual discriminations. However, redundancy was much higher (both in absolute terms and in proportion to the total information available in neuron pairs) in correct behavioural choices compared to incorrect ones, whereas synergy was higher in absolute terms but lower in relative terms in correct than in incorrect behavioural choices. Moreover, the proportion of redundancy reliably predicted perceptual discriminations, with the proportion of synergy adding no extra predictive power. These results suggest a crucial contribution of redundancy to correct perceptual discriminations, possibly due to the advantage it offers for information propagation, and also suggest a role of synergy in enhancing information level during correct discriminations.","Loren Koçillari, Marco Celotto, ...

Autoidentification and Sensorimotor Rehearsal as Physiological Mechanisms of Consciousness,/article/10.1007/s11055-021-01118-x,"This article addresses the nature and neurophysiological mechanisms of sensory awareness, conscious perception, generation of thought, imagination, intuition, and discursive thought. Sensory awareness and thought generation have been shown to be based on high-frequency cyclic autoidentification processes. Imagination and discursive thought are based on cyclic processes of sensorimotor rehearsal. Rehearsal is a low-frequency process (3–6 Hz) and its content is accessible for review by high-frequency autoidentification processes (30–70 Hz). The succession mental images, words, or symbols is controlled by the motor system and is accessible for review by autoidentification processes. The interaction of sensorimotor rehearsal and autoidentification mechanisms allows us to form images, scenes, and dialogs, to observe and change them, creating a mobile and controlled world of conscious experience. The mechanisms of autoidentification and sensorimotor rehearsal explain the nature of a wide spectrum of the properties of conscious brain activity, including such still-cryptic phenomena as hypnosis and meditation.",V.

Hardware implementation of radial-basis neural networks with Gaussian activation functions on FPGA,/article/10.1007/s00521-021-05706-3,"This article introduces a method for realizing the Gaussian activation function of radial-basis (RBF) neural networks with their hardware implementation on field-programmable gaits area (FPGAs). The results of modeling of the Gaussian function on FPGA chips of different families have been presented. RBF neural networks of various topologies have been synthesized and investigated. The hardware component implemented by this algorithm is an RBF neural network with four neurons of the latent layer and one neuron with a sigmoid activation function on an FPGA using 16-bit numbers with a fixed point, which took 1193 logic matrix gate (LUTs—LookUpTable). Each hidden layer neuron of the RBF network is designed on an FPGA as a separate computing unit. The speed as a total delay of the combination scheme of the block RBF network was 101.579 ns. The implementation of the Gaussian activation functions of the hidden layer of the RBF network occupies 106 LUTs, and the speed of the Gaussian activation functions is 29.33 ns. The absolute error is ± 0.005. The Spartan 3 family of chips for modeling has been used to get these results. Modeling on chips of other series has been also introduced in the article. RBF neural networks of various topologies have been synthesized and investigated. Hardware implementation of RBF neural networks with such speed allows them to be used in real-time control systems for high-speed objects.","Volodymyr Shymkovych, Sergii Telenyk, Petro Kravets",2021-03-13

An intelligent computational approach of signal control in urban rail transit for vehicular communication,/article/10.1007/s00500-023-08353-z,"With the rise in popularity of vehicular communication in the modern period, vehicles not only provide convenience for people’s movement, but also create traffic congestion. Urban rail transit plays an increasingly important role in modern urban public transport. To alleviate traffic congestion, a novel intelligent transportation approach has been developed, allowing the intelligent computing technology to be applied to the city’s traffic signal management system, which is critical to solving the city’s traffic problem. The goal of this study is to optimize the signal management system of urban traffic in order to reduce economic losses caused by traffic congestion, such as pollution and energy loss, relieve traffic congestion, and increase traffic efficiency. This paper first describes the existing traffic situation before highlighting the critical role of intelligent computing in urban traffic signal regulation. It then covers fuzzy control, fuzzy neural networks, traffic flow, queuing theory, and car following theory in general. The fuzzy control system for an urban intersection is then presented, the green light phase and red light phase modules are evaluated, and the fuzzy control method is introduced into the traffic signal control system research. The software for controlling the urban traffic trunk line with a fuzzy neural network system is then detailed, and a robust optimization model is constructed. Finally, to prove the superiority of intelligent calculation approach adopted by this study, a specific case study is provided which is coupled with the robust optimization model for comparison. The experimental results of this paper show that the robust optimized-cellular transportation approach of this study is stable, can successfully manage vehicle delays, and increase traffic efficiency. It reduces the average vehicle delay by 15.97%, the average number of stops by 9.88%, and increases the passing traffic by 10.32%.","Cong Huang, Ying Huang",2023-05-16
Organization of the inputs and outputs of the mouse superior colliculus,/article/10.1038/s41467-021-24241-2,"The superior colliculus (SC) receives diverse and robust cortical inputs to drive a range of cognitive and sensorimotor behaviors. However, it remains unclear how descending cortical input arising from higher-order associative areas coordinate with SC sensorimotor networks to influence its outputs. Here, we construct a comprehensive map of all cortico-tectal projections and identify four collicular zones with differential cortical inputs: medial (SC.m), centromedial (SC.cm), centrolateral (SC.cl) and lateral (SC.l). Further, we delineate the distinctive brain-wide input/output organization of each collicular zone, assemble multiple parallel cortico-tecto-thalamic subnetworks, and identify the somatotopic map in the SC that displays distinguishable spatial properties from the somatotopic maps in the neocortex and basal ganglia. Finally, we characterize interactions between those cortico-tecto-thalamic and cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic subnetworks. This study provides a structural basis for understanding how SC is involved in integrating different sensory modalities, translating sensory information to motor command, and coordinating different actions in goal-directed behaviors.","Nora L.

Promoting FAIR Data Through Community-driven Agile Design: the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (odc-sci.org),/article/10.1007/s12021-021-09533-8,"The past decade has seen accelerating movement from data protectionism in publishing toward open data sharing to improve reproducibility and translation of biomedical research. Developing data sharing infrastructures to meet these new demands remains a challenge. One model for data sharing involves simply attaching data, irrespective of its type, to publisher websites or general use repositories. However, some argue this creates a ‘data dump’ that does not promote the goals of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Specialized data sharing communities offer an alternative model where data are curated by domain experts to make it both open and FAIR. We report on our experiences developing one such data-sharing ecosystem focusing on ‘long-tail’ preclinical data, the Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury (odc-sci.org). ODC-SCI was developed with community-based agile design requirements directly pulled from a series of workshops with multiple stakeholders (researchers, consumers, non-profit funders, governmental agencies, journals, and industry members). ODC-SCI focuses on heterogeneous tabular data collected by preclinical researchers including bio-behaviour, histopathology findings and molecular endpoints. This has led to an example of a specialized neurocommons that is well-embraced by the community it aims to serve. In the present paper, we provide a review of the community-based design template and describe the adoption by the community including a high-level review of current data assets, publicly released datasets, and web analytics. Although odc-sci.org is in its late beta stage of development, it represents a successful example of a specialized data commons that may serve as a model for other fields.","Abel Torres-Espín, Carlos A.

"Cell numbers, distribution, shape, and regional variation throughout the murine hippocampal formation from the adult brain Allen Reference Atlas",/article/10.1007/s00429-019-01940-7,"Quantifying the distribution of cells in every brain region is fundamental to attaining a comprehensive census of distinct neuronal and glial types. Until recently, estimating neuron numbers involved time-consuming procedures that were practically limited to stereological sampling. Progress in open-source image recognition software, growth in computing power, and unprecedented neuroinformatics developments now offer the potentially paradigm-shifting alternative of comprehensive cell-by-cell analysis in an entire brain region. The Allen Brain Atlas provides free digital access to complete series of raw Nissl-stained histological section images along with regional delineations. Automated cell segmentation of these data enables reliable and reproducible high-throughput quantification of regional variations in cell count, density, size, and shape at whole-system scale. While this strategy is directly applicable to any regions of the mouse brain, we first deploy it here on the closed-loop circuit of the hippocampal formation: the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices; dentate gyrus (DG); areas Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3), CA2, and CA1; and dorsal and ventral subiculum. Using two independent image processing pipelines and the adult mouse reference atlas, we report the first cellular-level soma segmentation in every sub-region and non-principal layer of the left hippocampal formation through the full rostral-caudal extent. It is important to note that our techniques excluded the layers with the largest number of cells, DG granular and CA pyramidal, due to dense packing. The numerical estimates for the remaining layers are corroborated by traditional stereological sampling on a data subset and well match sparse published reports.","Sarojini M. Attili, Marcos F. M.

Neural Network Modeling and Organization of a Hierarchical Associative Memory System,/article/10.3103/S1052618821080148,"The organization of associative memory plays a crucial role in the efficiency of intelligent systems, software, and practical applications that require analysis and processing of big data and knowledge. A logical architecture of a neuro-like hierarchical pattern associative memory system, which provides storage of incoming information in the form of so-called patterns, is proposed and described. Patterns are hierarchically organized memory elements that make it possible to recover data from its part and find elements within automatically determined contexts on the basis of previously stored information. Modern approaches to the organization of associative memory in intelligent systems are considered. The main elements of pattern memory, i.e., pattern, neuron, mediator, and synapse, are defined. The basic concepts and principles of functioning of hierarchical pattern associative memory systems are described, and examples of practical implementation are given. Based on the principles described, it is possible to create specific memory versions for practical tasks, such as processing text, graphic, audio, and video information. Shared memory can be used to generalize various information flows into common logical chains of memories. It is concluded that the capabilities of the proposed hierarchical pattern memory systems for handling data make it possible to store information in intelligent systems and model the thinking process of an expert in the course of logical reasoning.",I.

Approaches to the Use of Graph Theory to Study the Human EEG in Health and Cerebral Pathology,/article/10.1007/s11055-023-01437-1,"The information content of EEG recordings, which are widely used and important for assessing the functional activity of the brain, is significantly increased by the use of mathematical analysis, where an important place is occupied by the spatial synchronization characteristic, i.e., the functional connectivity of biopotentials (based on correlation and coherence analysis, phase synchronization, etc.). The success of neuroimaging methods in recent years has not only confirmed the significance of this indicator, but has also contributed to improvements in approaches to its statistical evaluation and visualization. Graph theory (GT) is a promising method for analyzing the neural network organization of the brain. Its advantages are that it provides a visual description of the entire structure of the network and its individual components, as well as defining the relationships between them.

Transcranial direct current stimulation inhibits epileptic activity propagation in a large-scale brain network model,/article/10.1007/s11431-022-2341-x,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique that uses constant, low-intensity direct current to regulate brain activities. Clinical studies have shown that cathode-tDCS (c-tDCS) is effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. Due to the heterogeneity and patient specificity of seizures, patient-specific epilepsy networks are increasingly important in exploring the regulatory role of c-tDCS. In this study, we first set the left hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and amygdala as the epileptogenic zone (EZ), and the left inferior temporal cortex and ventral temporal cortex as the initial propagation zone (PZ) to establish a large-scale epilepsy network model. Then we set tDCS cathode locations according to the maximum average energy of the simulated EEG signals and systematically study c-tDCS inhibitory effects on the propagation of epileptic activity. The results show that c-tDCS is effective in suppressing the propagation of epileptic activity. Further, to consider the patient specificity, we set specific EZ and PZ according to the clinical diagnosis of 6 patients and establish patient-specific epileptic networks. We find that c-tDCS can suppress the propagation of abnormal activity in most patient-specific epileptic networks. However, when the PZ is widely distributed in both hemispheres, the treatment effect of c-tDCS is not satisfactory. Hence, we propose dual-cathode tDCS. For epilepsy models with a wide distribution of PZ, it can inhibit the propagation of epileptiform activity in other nodes except EZ and PZ without increasing the tDCS current strength. Our results provide theoretical support for the treatment of epilepsy with tDCS.","Ying Yu, YuBo Fan, ... QingYun Wang",2023-11-20
Development of a deep learning model for recognising traffic sings focused on difficult cases,/article/10.1007/s12652-021-03609-8,"The automotive industry is expanding its efforts to develop new techniques for increasing the level of intelligent driving and create new autonomous cars capable of driving with more intelligent capabilities. Thus, companies in this sector are turning to the development of autonomous cars and more specifically developing software along with more artificial intelligent algorithms. However, to be able to trust these systems, they must be developed very carefully, and use techniques that can increase the level of recognition that will consequently improve the level of safety. One of the most important components in this respect for road users is the correct interpretation of traffic sings. This paper presents a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks and image processing that can be used to improve the recognition of traffic sings autonomously. The results are focused on difficult cases such as images with lighting problems, blurry traffic sings, hidden traffic sings, and small images. Hence, real cases are used in this study for identifying the existing problems and achieving good performance in traffic signal recognition. Finally, as a result, the configuration of the neural architecture based on three phases of convolutions proposed shows a validation accuracy of 99.3% during the data training. Another comparison carried out with the model ResNet-50 obtained an accuracy of 88.5%. Thus, for this type of application, a high validation accuracy is required as the results of our model demonstrated.","Vanessa De Arriba López, Salvador Cobos-Guzman",2021-12-01

We overview here this evolution in four categories: content, applications, functionality, and availability, in contrast to other works limited mostly to content. Four atlas generations are distinguished: early cortical maps, print stereotactic atlases, early digital atlases, and advanced brain atlas platforms, and 5 avenues in electronic atlases spanning the last two generations. Content-wise, new electronic atlases are categorized into eight groups considering their scope, parcellation, modality, plurality, scale, ethnicity, abnormality, and a mixture of them. Atlas content developments in these groups are heading in 23 various directions. Application-wise, we overview atlases in neuroeducation, research, and clinics, including stereotactic and functional neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, and stroke. Functionality-wise, tools and functionalities are addressed for atlas creation, navigation, individualization, enabling operations, and application-specific. Availability is discussed in media and platforms, ranging from mobile solutions to leading-edge supercomputers, with three accessibility levels. The major application-wise shift has been from research to clinical practice, particularly in stereotactic and functional neurosurgery, although clinical applications are still lagging behind the atlas content progress. Atlas functionality also has been relatively neglected until recently, as the management of brain data explosion requires powerful tools. We suggest that the future human brain atlas-related research and development activities shall be founded on and benefit from a standard framework containing the core virtual brain model cum the brain atlas platform general architecture.",Wieslaw L.

Optical Imaging of the Visual Cortex: Spectral and Amplitude Characteristics of Vasomotor Oscillations,/article/10.1007/s11055-023-01459-9,"Intrinsic signal optical imaging is widely used in current studies of the functional anatomy of the cerebral cortex. However, the recorded optical signal, which correlates with neuronal activity, is masked by background activity, which can exceed the amplitude of the useful imaging signal by an order of magnitude. The signal contains spontaneous oscillations with frequencies in the range 0.01-0.15 Hz, called vasomotor oscillations, as one of the components of background activity. The studies reported here identified vasomotor oscillations in three areas of interest: nervous tissue, large arterioles, and the dura mater. Vasomotor oscillations in nervous tissue and blood vessels have different spectral and amplitude characteristics. Nonetheless, there is a high level of coherence between the oscillations recorded in these regions of interest.

Recent times have seen an increase in interest in the use of neuroimaging in studies of spatially distributed information using multidimensional approaches such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We report here the use of MVPA to analyze fMRI data recorded during a task involving assessment of the self and other people of different degrees of closeness. Testing of the patterns identified by machine learning showed that these brain activity patterns predicted what the subject was assessing self or other in 75–88% of cases. Prognostically significant structures were widely distributed in different areas of the brain and, in addition to the cortical median structures making the greatest contribution, included areas of the visual, lateral prefrontal, and many other cortical areas. The most informative areas for the selection of the Self variant on classifying self/other were the ventral regions of the medial prefrontal and cingulate cortex, while for selection of Other the most informative were the parietal and occipital median areas. Principal components analysis revealed a combination of brain structures, including the anterior cingulate gyrus and the bilateral amygdalas, whose factor scores correlated positively with the psychometric reward sensitivity scale and negatively with the neuroticism scale. Activity in this combination of structures can be regarded as a protective factor against affective disorders. In general, the results obtained here demonstrate the productivity of using machine learning methods for analysis of data from experiments of this type.","G. G. Knyazev, A. N. Savostyanov, ... A. V.

Waxholm Space atlas of the rat brain: a 3D atlas supporting data analysis and integration,/article/10.1038/s41592-023-02034-3,"Volumetric brain atlases are increasingly used to integrate and analyze diverse experimental neuroscience data acquired from animal models, but until recently a publicly available digital atlas with complete coverage of the rat brain has been missing. Here we present an update of the Waxholm Space rat brain atlas, a comprehensive open-access volumetric atlas resource. This brain atlas features annotations of 222 structures, of which 112 are new and 57 revised compared to previous versions. It provides a detailed map of the cerebral cortex, hippocampal region, striatopallidal areas, midbrain dopaminergic system, thalamic cell groups, the auditory system and main fiber tracts. We document the criteria underlying the annotations and demonstrate how the atlas with related tools and workflows can be used to support interpretation, integration, analysis and dissemination of experimental rat brain data.","Heidi Kleven, Ingvild E.

Enhanced and unified anatomical labeling for a common mouse brain atlas,/article/10.1038/s41467-019-13057-w,"Anatomical atlases in standard coordinates are necessary for the interpretation and integration of research findings in a common spatial context. However, the two most-used mouse brain atlases, the Franklin-Paxinos (FP) and the common coordinate framework (CCF) from the Allen Institute for Brain Science, have accumulated inconsistencies in anatomical delineations and nomenclature, creating confusion among neuroscientists. To overcome these issues, we adopt here the FP labels into the CCF to merge the labels in the single atlas framework. We use cell type-specific transgenic mice and an MRI atlas to adjust and further segment our labels. Moreover, detailed segmentations are added to the dorsal striatum using cortico-striatal connectivity data. Lastly, we digitize our anatomical labels based on the Allen ontology, create a web-interface for visualization, and provide tools for comprehensive comparisons between the CCF and FP labels. Our open-source labels signify a key step towards a unified mouse brain atlas.","Uree Chon, Daniel J. Vanselow, ... Yongsoo Kim",2019-11-07
"Contribution of Epigenetic Mechanisms to the Formation, Maintenance, and Reconsolidation of a Long-Term Food-Related Aversive Memory in Terrestrial Snails",/article/10.1007/s11055-024-01576-z,"The study reported here analyzed the role of epigenetic mechanisms (histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and histone serotonylation) in the formation, storage, and reconsolidation of long-term food-related aversive memory in snails. The first part of the work addressed the effect of systemic administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate in a model of conditioned reflex food aversion in snails. Administration of sodium butyrate to animals with poor memory was found to result in enhancement of memory. Administration of the DNA methyltransferase blocker RG108 showed that impaired DNA methylation degraded long-term food-related aversive memory in snails. However, memory reactivation neutralized the effect of inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity. The final section of the work tested the hypothesis that transglutaminase-mediated serotonylation is involved in the processes of reconsolidation of an aversive food-related memory in snails. Behavioral analysis showed that administration of the transglutaminase blocker monodansylcadaverine (producing blockade of serotonylation) after a reminder disrupted the reconsolidation process and led to memory suppression/erasure.","A.

Cerebral μ-opioid and CB1 receptor systems have distinct roles in human feeding behavior,/article/10.1038/s41398-021-01559-5,"Eating behavior varies greatly between individuals, but the neurobiological basis of these trait-like differences in feeding remains poorly understood. Central μ-opioid receptors (MOR) and cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1R) regulate energy balance via multiple neural pathways, promoting food intake and reward. Because obesity and eating disorders have been associated with alterations in the brain’s opioid and endocannabinoid signaling, the variation in MOR and CB1R system function could potentially underlie distinct eating behavior phenotypes. In this retrospective positron emission tomography (PET) study, we analyzed [11C]carfentanil PET scans of MORs from 92 healthy subjects (70 males and 22 females), and [18F]FMPEP-d2 scans of CB1Rs from 35 subjects (all males, all also included in the [11C]carfentanil sample). Eating styles were measured with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ). We found that lower cerebral MOR availability was associated with increased external eating—individuals with low MORs reported being more likely to eat in response to environment’s palatable food cues. CB1R availability was associated with multiple eating behavior traits. We conclude that although MORs and CB1Rs overlap anatomically in brain regions regulating food reward, they have distinct roles in mediating individual feeding patterns. Central MOR system might provide a pharmacological target for reducing individual’s excessive cue-reactive eating behavior.","Tatu Kantonen, Tomi Karjalainen, ... Lauri Nummenmaa",2021-08-27
Interaction of Foveal and Peripheral Vision on Implementation of Systemic Visual Functions,/article/10.1007/s11055-022-01257-9,"This article analyzes known data on the systemic functions of vision, such as discrimination and recognition of visual objects, visual seeking, assessment of the emotional content of scenes, and decision-making in the foveal and peripheral visual fields. Existing hypotheses for the possible mechanisms of functional phenomena occurring in the human peripheral field are discussed. A neurological informatic approach to solving problems of the interaction of foveal and peripheral vision based on inspection trajectories, areas of interest, and return gaze fixations are described. Computer experiments showed that the structure of an inspection trajectory model correlates with the number of return fixations of the “input window” of the model. This suggested that the probability of return fixations could be regarded as a quantitative criterion for identifying the type of attention (focal or spatial) and the moment of attention-switching.","L.

Synchronization transition of a modular neural network containing subnetworks of different scales,/article/10.1631/FITEE.2300008,"Time delay and coupling strength are important factors that affect the synchronization of neural networks. In this study, a modular neural network containing subnetworks of different scales was constructed using the Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) neural model; i.e., a small-scale random network was unidirectionally connected to a large-scale small-world network through chemical synapses. Time delays were found to induce multiple synchronization transitions in the network. An increase in coupling strength also promoted synchronization of the network when the time delay was an integer multiple of the firing period of a single neuron. Considering that time delays at different locations in a modular network may have different effects, we explored the influence of time delays within each subnetwork and between two subnetworks on the synchronization of modular networks. We found that when the subnetworks were well synchronized internally, an increase in the time delay within both subnetworks induced multiple synchronization transitions of their own. In addition, the synchronization state of the small-scale network affected the synchronization of the large-scale network. It was surprising to find that an increase in the time delay between the two subnetworks caused the synchronization factor of the modular network to vary periodically, but it had essentially no effect on the synchronization within the receiving subnetwork. By analyzing the phase difference between the two subnetworks, we found that the mechanism of the periodic variation of the synchronization factor of the modular network was the periodic variation of the phase difference. Finally, the generality of the results was demonstrated by investigating modular networks at different scales.","Weifang Huang, Lijian Yang, ... Ya Jia",2023-10-01

Through visits in Düsseldorf and later in Jülich, where Dr. Zilles established a Neuroscience Research Institute in the former nuclear research facility, we had many discussions about how a common anatomical framework, unconstrained by a single technique or level of analysis, can provide an opportunity to integrate the massive amount of data from genes and molecules to behavior and cognition to explore structure–function relationship from a new perspective.",Laszlo Zaborszky,2021-08-10
A Convolutional System Identification Approach Mixing Optimal Parameter Estimation and Deep Learning,/article/10.1007/s12555-022-0070-3,"Experimental identification (EI) methods are often discussed in the literature because of the importance of building reliable dynamical models and control systems. This is especially true when thinking about autonomous vehicle control. An important characteristic of EI approaches is the necessity of a signal with good excitation properties to model the system, which is usually obtained by optimal input design approaches. Although this is a method that reproduces the actual behavior through a mathematical tool, it can ignore unmodeled features such as asymmetry or even constructive addictions. In this way, this work aims to construct a hybrid identification method through a mathematical model estimated in convolution with a deep neural network (DNN). The Gated recurrent unit (GRU) must be able to determine the states of the next instant based on the input and output of the theoretical model. The results are promising and suggest that this association is valid and capable of refining the outputs of a purely mathematical model.","Marina Borges Arantes Souza, Accacio F. dos Santos Neto, ...

Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations. The goal of the The Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center (JAX NSC) is to provide research resources and training for geroscience investigators that seek to understand the role of genetics and genetic diversity on the fundamental process of aging and diseases of human aging using the laboratory mouse as a model system. The JAX NSC has available novel, deeply characterized populations of aged mice, performs state-of-the-art phenotyping of age-relevant traits, provides systems genetics analysis of complex data sets, and provides all of these resources to the geroscience community. The aged animal resources, phenotyping capacity, and genetic expertise available through the JAX NSC benefit the geroscience community by fostering cutting-edge, novel lines of research that otherwise would not be possible. Over the past 15 years, the JAX NSC has transformed aging research across the geroscience community, providing aging mouse resources and tissues to researchers. All JAX NSC data and tools are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center are readily available to the aging research community. The JAX NSC will continue to enhance its ability to perform innovative research using a mammalian model to illuminate novel genotype–phenotype relationships and provide a rational basis for designing effective risk assessments and therapeutic interventions to boost longevity and disease-free healthspan.","Ron Korstanje, Luanne L.

Opportunities and Challenges in High-Quality Contemporary Data Collection in Traumatic Brain Injury: The CENTER-TBI Experience,/article/10.1007/s12028-022-01471-w,"Strong evidence in support of guidelines for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is lacking. Large-scale observational studies may offer a complementary source of evidence to clinical trials to improve the care and outcome for patients with TBI. They are, however, challenging to execute. In this review, we aim to characterize opportunities and challenges of large-scale collaborative research in neurotrauma. We use the setup and conduct of Collaborative European Neurotrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) as an illustrative example. We highlight the importance of building a team and of developing a network for younger researchers, thus investing toward the future. We involved investigators early in the design phase and recognized their efforts in a group contributor list on all publications. We found, however, that translation to academic credits often failed, and we suggest that the current system of academic credits be critically appraised. We found substantial variability in consent procedures for participant enrollment within and between countries. Overall, obtaining approvals typically required 4–6 months, with outliers up to 18 months. Research costs varied considerably across Europe and should be defined by center. We substantially underestimated costs of data curation, and we suggest that 15–20% of the budget be reserved for this purpose. Streamlining analyses and accommodating external research proposals demanded a structured approach. We implemented a systematic inventory of study plans and found this effective in maintaining oversight and in promoting collaboration between research groups. Ensuring good use of the data was a prominent feature in the review of external proposals. Multiple interactions occurred with industrial partners, mainly related to biomarkers and neuroimaging, and resulted in various formal collaborations, substantially extending the scope of CENTER-TBI. Overall, CENTER-TBI has been productive, with over 250 international peer-reviewed publications. We have ensured mechanisms to maintain the infrastructure and continued analyses. We see potential for individual patient data meta-analyses in connection to other large-scale projects. Our collaboration with Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) has taught us that although standardized data collection and coding according to common data elements can facilitate such meta-analyses, further data harmonization is required for meaningful results. Both CENTER-TBI and TRACK-TBI have demonstrated the complexity of the conduct of large-scale collaborative studies that produce high-quality science and new insights.","Andrew I. R.

BigNeuron: a resource to benchmark and predict performance of algorithms for automated tracing of neurons in light microscopy datasets,/article/10.1038/s41592-023-01848-5,"BigNeuron is an open community bench-testing platform with the goal of setting open standards for accurate and fast automatic neuron tracing. We gathered a diverse set of image volumes across several species that is representative of the data obtained in many neuroscience laboratories interested in neuron tracing. Here, we report generated gold standard manual annotations for a subset of the available imaging datasets and quantified tracing quality for 35 automatic tracing algorithms. The goal of generating such a hand-curated diverse dataset is to advance the development of tracing algorithms and enable generalizable benchmarking. Together with image quality features, we pooled the data in an interactive web application that enables users and developers to perform principal component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, correlation and clustering, visualization of imaging and tracing data, and benchmarking of automatic tracing algorithms in user-defined data subsets. The image quality metrics explain most of the variance in the data, followed by neuromorphological features related to neuron size. We observed that diverse algorithms can provide complementary information to obtain accurate results and developed a method to iteratively combine methods and generate consensus reconstructions. The consensus trees obtained provide estimates of the neuron structure ground truth that typically outperform single algorithms in noisy datasets. However, specific algorithms may outperform the consensus tree strategy in specific imaging conditions. Finally, to aid users in predicting the most accurate automatic tracing results without manual annotations for comparison, we used support vector machine regression to predict reconstruction quality given an image volume and a set of automatic tracings.","Linus Manubens-Gil, Zhi Zhou, ...

Brain works principle followed by neural information processing: a review of novel brain theory,/article/10.1007/s10462-023-10520-5,"The way the brain work and its principle of work has long been a big scientific question that scientists have dreamed of solving. However, as is known to all, the brain works at different levels, and the operation at different levels is interactional and mutually coupled. Unfortunately, until now, we still do not know how the nervous system at different levels is interacting and coupling with each other. This review provides some preliminary discussions on how to address these scientific questions, for which we propose a novel theory of the brain called neural energy. Such a theoretical and research approach can couple neural information with neural energy to address the interactions of the nervous system at various levels. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes the neural energy theories and methods proposed by our research in the field of brain science, as well as the internal relationship between mechanics and neural energy theory. Focuses on how to construct a Wang–Zhang (W–Z) neuron model equivalent to Hodgkin–Huxley (H–H) model by using the idea of analytical dynamics. Then, based on this model, we proposed a large-scale neural model and a theoretical framework of global neural coding of the brain in the field of neuroscience. It includes information processing of multiple sensory and perceptual nervous systems such as visual perception, neural mechanism of coupling between default mode network and functional network of brain, memory switching and brain state switching, brain navigation, prediction of new working mechanism of neurons, and interpretation of experimental phenomena that are difficult to be explained by neuroscience. It is proved that the new W–Z neuron model and neural energy theory have unique functions and advantages in neural modeling, neural information processing and methodology. The idea of large-scale neuroscience research with neural energy as the core will provide a potentially powerful research method for promoting the fusion of experimental neuroscience and theoretical neuroscience in the future, and propose a widely accepted brain theory system between experimental neuroscience and theoretical neuroscience. It is of great scientific significance to abandon the shortcomings of reductive and holism research methods in the field of neuroscience, and effectively integrate their respective advantages in methodology.","Rubin Wang, Yihong Wang, ...

Predicting microbial extracellular electron transfer activity in paddy soils with soil physicochemical properties using machine learning,/article/10.1007/s11431-023-2537-y,"Soil extracellular electron transfer (EET) is a pivotal biological process within the realm of soil. Unfortunately, EET suffers from a lack of predictive models. Herein, an intricately crafted machine learning model has been developed for the purpose of predicting soil EET by using the physicochemical properties of soil as independent input variables and the EET capabilities in terms of current density (jmax) and Coulombic charge (Cout) as dependent output variables. An autoencoder ensemble stacking (AES) model was developed to address the aforementioned issue by integrating support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine algorithms as the stacking algorithms. With 10-fold cross-validation, the AES model exhibited notable improvements in predicting jmax and Cout, with average test R2 values of 0.83 and 0.84, respectively, surpassing those of single machine learning (ML) models and the basic ensemble model. By utilizing partial correlation plots (PDPs), Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) values, and SHAP decision plots, we quantitatively explained the impact and contribution of the input molecules on the AES model’s predictions of jmax and Cout. In the context of the SHAP method for the AES model, total carbon (TC) was identified as the most correlated descriptor for jmax, while total organic carbon (TOC) stood out as the most relevant descriptor for Cout. In the prediction tasks of jmax and Cout within the AES model, employing a multitask ML approach allowed the model to benefit from the shared information of input variables, thereby enhancing its overall generalizability. This study provides a feasible tool for the prediction of soil EET from soil physiochemical properties and an advanced understanding of the relationship between soil physiochemical properties and EET capability.","JiaJun Ou, XiaoShan Luo, ...

Exploiting deterministic features in apparently stochastic data,/article/10.1038/s41598-022-23212-x,"Many processes in nature are the result of many coupled individual subsystems (like population dynamics or neurosystems). Not always such systems exhibit simple stable behaviors that in the past science has mostly focused on. Often, these systems are characterized by bursts of seemingly stochastic activity, interrupted by quieter periods. The hypothesis is that the presence of a strong deterministic ingredient is often obscured by the stochastic features. We test this by modeling classically stochastic considered real-world data from both, the stochastic as well as the deterministic approaches to find that the deterministic approach’s results level with those from the stochastic side. Moreover, the deterministic approach is shown to reveal the full dynamical systems landscape, which can be exploited for steering the dynamics into a desired regime.","Ruedi Stoop, Giuseppe Orlando, ...

Generating Longitudinal Atrophy Evaluation Datasets on Brain Magnetic Resonance Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Segmentation Priors,/article/10.1007/s12021-020-09499-z,"Brain atrophy quantification plays a fundamental role in neuroinformatics since it permits studying brain development and neurological disorders. However, the lack of a ground truth prevents testing the accuracy of longitudinal atrophy quantification methods. We propose a deep learning framework to generate longitudinal datasets by deforming T1-w brain magnetic resonance imaging scans as requested through segmentation maps. Our proposal incorporates a cascaded multi-path U-Net optimised with a multi-objective loss which allows its paths to generate different brain regions accurately. We provided our model with baseline scans and real follow-up segmentation maps from two longitudinal datasets, ADNI and OASIS, and observed that our framework could produce synthetic follow-up scans that matched the real ones (Total scans= 584; Median absolute error: 0.03 ± 0.02; Structural similarity index: 0.98 ± 0.02; Dice similarity coefficient: 0.95 ± 0.02; Percentage of brain volume change: 0.24 ± 0.16; Jacobian integration: 1.13 ± 0.05). Compared to two relevant works generating brain lesions using U-Nets and conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), our proposal outperformed them significantly in most cases (p < 0.01), except in the delineation of brain edges where the CGAN took the lead (Jacobian integration: Ours - 1.13 ± 0.05 vs CGAN - 1.00 ± 0.02; p < 0.01). We examined whether changes induced with our framework were detected by FAST, SPM, SIENA, SIENAX, and the Jacobian integration method. We observed that induced and detected changes were highly correlated (Adj. R2 > 0.86). Our preliminary results on harmonised datasets showed the potential of our framework to be applied to various data collections without further adjustment.","Jose Bernal, Sergi Valverde, ...

Broadening the discussion about theoretical approaches and expanding the computational tools is necessary to better understand astrocytes’ roles in brain functions.","Tiina Manninen, Jugoslava Aćimović, Marja-Leena Linne",2023-03-23
"Computational thinking for the digital age: a systematic review of tools, pedagogical strategies, and assessment practices",/article/10.1007/s11423-024-10364-y,"Computational thinking (CT) has received growing interest as a research subject in the last decade, with research contributions attempting to capitalize on the benefits that CT may provide. This study included a systematic analysis aimed at revealing current trends in the CT subject, identifying educational interventions, and emerging assessment instruments. It also gave an overview of how teachers learned CT skills and how they integrated the CT curriculum into classroom practices. We searched the data in the Web of Science database and identified 360 articles. Most importantly, it emphasized the following points: (a) the most popular subject areas in CT literature; (b) CT intervention tools; (c) CT assessment practices used so far within educational courses; and (d) effective CT approaches to influence pre-service teachers. Results from this review revealed that CT’s promotion in education had achieved significant progress in recent years. Along with the growth in the number of CT studies, the number of subjects, research questions, and teaching approaches also increased in recent years. It was also found that CT was mostly used in science, mathematics, programming, and computer science tasks, with little work in artificial intelligence (AI) and non-STEM areas. The essence of this paper implicated the researchers in designing the curriculum based on different subject domains. Furthermore, we recommended integrating augmented reality-based games using CT methodologies into the curriculum.","Toluchuri Shalini Shanker Rao, Kaushal Kumar Bhagat",2024-04-05
Decoding six basic emotions from brain functional connectivity patterns,/article/10.1007/s11427-022-2206-3,"Although distinctive neural and physiological states are suggested to underlie the six basic emotions, basic emotions are often indistinguishable from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) voxelwise activation (VA) patterns. Here, we hypothesize that functional connectivity (FC) patterns across brain regions may contain emotion-representation information beyond VA patterns. We collected whole-brain fMRI data while human participants viewed pictures of faces expressing one of the six basic emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) or showing neutral expressions. We obtained FC patterns for each emotion across brain regions over the whole brain and applied multivariate pattern decoding to decode emotions in the FC pattern representation space. Our results showed that the whole-brain FC patterns successfully classified not only the six basic emotions from neutral expressions but also each basic emotion from other emotions. An emotion-representation network for each basic emotion that spanned beyond the classical brain regions for emotion processing was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that within the same brain regions, FC-based decoding consistently performed better than VA-based decoding. Taken together, our findings revealed that FC patterns contained emotional information and advocated for paying further attention to the contribution of FCs to emotion processing.","Chunyu Liu, Yingying Wang, ...

The NanoZoomer artificial intelligence connectomics pipeline for tracer injection studies of the marmoset brain,/article/10.1007/s00429-020-02073-y,"We describe our connectomics pipeline for processing anterograde tracer injection data for the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Brain sections were imaged using a batch slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0-HT) and we used artificial intelligence to precisely segment the tracer signal from the background in the fluorescence images. The shape of each brain was reconstructed by reference to a block-face and all data were mapped into a common 3D brain space with atlas and 2D cortical flat map. To overcome the effect of using a single template atlas to specify cortical boundaries, brains were cyto- and myelo-architectonically annotated to create individual 3D atlases. Registration between the individual and common brain cortical boundaries in the flat map space was done to absorb the variation of each brain and precisely map all tracer injection data into one cortical brain space. We describe the methodology of our pipeline and analyze the accuracy of our tracer segmentation and brain registration approaches. Results show our pipeline can successfully process and normalize tracer injection experiments into a common space, making it suitable for large-scale connectomics studies with a focus on the cerebral cortex.","Alexander Woodward, Rui Gong, ...

These plots that are generated by the python script inside the python script in a python notebook are useful in understanding changes in various performance metrics with variation in the number of processes and the problem size. A comparative study was also performed between two simple algorithms which are the multiplication using repeated addition algorithm (which is not computationally intensive) and the matrix multiplication algorithm (which is computationally intensive), and meaningful insights were provided to show the difference in performance of both the algorithms with a variation in the problem size and the number of processors.

Investigating the contribution of white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness to empathy in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases,/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00539-x,"Change in empathy is an increasingly recognised symptom of neurodegenerative diseases and contributes to caregiver burden and patient distress. Empathy impairment has been associated with brain atrophy but its relationship to white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the relationships amongst WMH, brain atrophy, and empathy deficits in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Five hundred thirteen participants with Alzheimer’s disease/mild cognitive impairment, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson’s disease, or cerebrovascular disease (CVD) were included. Empathy was assessed using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. WMH were measured using a semi-automatic segmentation and FreeSurfer was used to measure cortical thickness. A heterogeneous pattern of cortical thinning was found between groups, with FTD showing thinning in frontotemporal regions and CVD in left superior parietal, left insula, and left postcentral. Results from both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that several variables were associated with empathy, particularly cortical thickness in the fronto-insulo-temporal and cingulate regions, sex (female), global cognition, and right parietal and occipital WMH. Our results suggest that cortical atrophy and WMH may be associated with empathy deficits in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Future work should consider investigating the longitudinal effects of WMH and atrophy on empathy deficits in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.","Miracle Ozzoude, Brenda Varriano, ...

Dynamic prediction of moving trajectory in pipe jacking: GRU-based deep learning framework,/article/10.1007/s11709-023-0942-5,"The moving trajectory of the pipe-jacking machine (PJM), which primarily determines the end quality of jacked tunnels, must be controlled strictly during the entire jacking process. Developing prediction models to support drivers in performing rectifications in advance can effectively avoid considerable trajectory deviations from the designed jacking axis. Hence, a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based deep learning framework is proposed herein to dynamically predict the moving trajectory of the PJM. In this framework, operational data are first extracted from a data acquisition system; subsequently, they are preprocessed and used to establish GRU-based multivariate multistep-ahead direct prediction models. To verify the performance of the proposed framework, a case study of a large pipe-jacking project in Shanghai and comparisons with other conventional models (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) network and recurrent neural network (RNN)) are conducted. In addition, the effects of the activation function and input time-step length on the prediction performance of the proposed framework are investigated and discussed. The results show that the proposed framework can dynamically and precisely predict the PJM moving trajectory during the pipe-jacking process, with a minimum mean absolute error and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.1904 and 0.5011 mm, respectively. The RMSE of the GRU-based models is lower than those of the LSTM- and RNN-based models by 21.46% and 46.40% at the maximum, respectively. The proposed framework is expected to provide an effective decision support for moving trajectory control and serve as a foundation for the application of deep learning in the automatic control of pipe jacking.","Yi-Feng Yang, Shao-Ming Liao, Meng-Bo Liu",2023-07-01
fMRIflows: A Consortium of Fully Automatic Univariate and Multivariate fMRI Processing Pipelines,/article/10.1007/s10548-022-00935-8,"How functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are analyzed depends on the researcher and the toolbox used. It is not uncommon that the processing pipeline is rewritten for each new dataset. Consequently, code transparency, quality control and objective analysis pipelines are important for improving reproducibility in neuroimaging studies. Toolboxes, such as Nipype and fMRIPrep, have documented the need for and interest in automated pre-processing analysis pipelines. Recent developments in data-driven models combined with high resolution neuroimaging dataset have strengthened the need not only for a standardized preprocessing workflow, but also for a reliable and comparable statistical pipeline. Here, we introduce fMRIflows: a consortium of fully automatic neuroimaging pipelines for fMRI analysis, which performs standard preprocessing, as well as 1st- and 2nd-level univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition to the standardized pre-processing pipelines, fMRIflows provides flexible temporal and spatial filtering to account for datasets with increasingly high temporal resolution and to help appropriately prepare data for advanced machine learning analyses, improving signal decoding accuracy and reliability. This paper first describes fMRIflows’ structure and functionality, then explains its infrastructure and access, and lastly validates the toolbox by comparing it to other neuroimaging processing pipelines such as fMRIPrep, FSL and SPM. This validation was performed on three datasets with varying temporal sampling and acquisition parameters to prove its flexibility and robustness. fMRIflows is a fully automatic fMRI processing pipeline which uniquely offers univariate and multivariate single-subject and group analyses as well as pre-processing.","Michael P.

Reservoir consisting of diverse dynamical behaviors and its application in time series classification,/article/10.1007/s41060-022-00360-x,"Time series classification (TSC) has been tackled through a wide range of algorithms. Seminal reservoir computing (s-RC) is composed of a recurrent neural network with random parameters serves as a dynamical memory and is a well-known end-to-end neural networks (NNs) that have been applied to TSC problems. Although the s-RC architecture is suited for dynamic (temporal) data processing, nevertheless choosing the proper design of reservoir plays a crucial role in the efficiency of reservoir computing (RC) in comparison to state-of-the-art fully trainable NNs. In contrast with a large body of researches that has been focused on the aspect of sparsity in the design of RC, in this article, the role of a variety of dynamical behaviors (e.g. stability, periodicity, high-periodicity, and chaos) in RC design is empirically investigated in terms of the richness of the developed dynamical (temporal) representations. Finally, it is shown that RCs with rich dynamical behaviors outperform RCs with a limited spectrum of dynamic behavior in TSC tasks. To evaluate the TSC adaptability of the newly proposed RC framework and state-of-the-art NN-based methods, different experiments on 15 multivariate time series datasets (UCR and UEA datasets) were performed. Our findings divulge that the proposed framework outperforms other RC methods in learning capacity and accuracy and attains classification accuracy comparable with the best fully trainable deep neural networks.","Mohammad Modiri, Mohammad Mehdi Ebadzadeh, Mohammad Mehdi Homayounpour",2022-09-02

This vision extends beyond efforts by individual scientists seeking to release individual datasets, software tools, or building platforms that provide for the free dissemination of such information. It involves multiple stakeholders and an infrastructure that considers governance, ethics, computational resourcing, physical design, workflows, training, education, and intra-institutional reporting structures. The C-BIG repository was built in response as The Neuro’s institutional biospecimen and clinical data repository, and collects biospecimens as well as clinical, imaging, and genetic data from patients with neurological disease and healthy controls. It is aimed at helping scientific investigators, in both academia and industry, advance our understanding of neurological diseases and accelerate the development of treatments. As many neurological diseases are quite rare, they present several challenges to researchers due to their small patient populations. Overcoming these challenges required the aggregation of datasets from various projects and locations. The C-BIG repository achieves this goal and stands as a scalable working model for institutions to collect, track, curate, archive, and disseminate multimodal data from patients.

Predicting CircRNA-Disease Associations Based on Improved Weighted Biased Meta-Structure,/article/10.1007/s11390-021-0798-x,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are RNAs with a special closed loop structure, which play important roles in tumors and other diseases. Due to the time consumption of biological experiments, computational methods for predicting associations between circRNAs and diseases become a better choice. Taking the limited number of verified circRNA-disease associations into account, we propose a method named CDWBMS, which integrates a small number of verified circRNA-disease associations with a plenty of circRNA information to discover the novel circRNA-disease associations. CDWBMS adopts an improved weighted biased meta-structure search algorithm on a heterogeneous network to predict associations between circRNAs and diseases. In terms of leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV), 10-fold cross-validation and 5-fold cross-validation, CDWBMS yields the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.921 6, 0.917 2 and 0.900 5, respectively.

Analyzing Thalamocortical Tract-Tracing Experiments in a Common Reference Space,/article/10.1007/s12021-023-09644-4,"Current mesoscale connectivity atlases provide limited information about the organization of thalamocortical projections in the mouse brain. Labeling the projections of spatially restricted neuron populations in thalamus can provide a functionally relevant level of connectomic analysis, but these need to be integrated within the same common reference space. Here, we present a pipeline for the segmentation, registration, integration and analysis of multiple tract-tracing experiments. The key difference with other workflows is that the data is transformed to fit the reference template. As a test-case, we investigated the axonal projections and intranuclear arrangement of seven neuronal populations of the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM), which we labeled with an anterograde tracer. Their soma positions corresponded, from dorsal to ventral, to cortical representations of the whiskers, nose and mouth. They strongly targeted layer 4, with the majority exclusively targeting one cortical area and the ones in ventrolateral VPM branching to multiple somatosensory areas. We found that our experiments were more topographically precise than similar experiments from the Allen Institute and projections to the primary somatosensory area were in agreement with single-neuron morphological reconstructions from publicly available databases. This pilot study sets the basis for a shared virtual connectivity atlas that could be enriched with additional data for studying the topographical organization of different thalamic nuclei. The pipeline is accessible with only minimal programming skills via a Jupyter Notebook, and offers multiple visualization tools such as cortical flatmaps, subcortical plots and 3D renderings and can be used with custom anatomical delineations.","Nestor Timonidis, Mario Rubio-Teves, ...

Response to “Fallacies of Mice Experiments”,/article/10.1007/s12021-019-09433-y,"In a recent Editorial, De Schutter commented on our recent study on the roles of a cortico-cerebellar loop in motor planning in mice (De Schutter 2019, Neuroinformatics, 17, 181–183, Gao et al. 2018, Nature, 563, 113–116). Two issues were raised. First, De Schutter questions the involvement of the fastigial nucleus in motor planning, rather than the dentate nucleus, given previous anatomical studies in non-human primates. Second, De Schutter suggests that our study design did not delineate different components of the behavior and the fastigial nucleus might play roles in sensory discrimination rather than motor planning. These comments are based on anatomical studies in other species and homology-based arguments and ignore key anatomical data and neurophysiological experiments from our study. Here we outline our interpretation of existing data and point out gaps in knowledge where future studies are needed.","Zhenyu Gao, Alyse M. Thomas, ... Nuo Li",2019-08-03
β-Amyloid and Lithium Affect the Magnitude of Phasic Dopamine Release in the Shell of the Nucleus Accumbens,/article/10.1007/s11055-021-01058-6,"Published data indicate that impairments to dopaminergic secretion in the shell of the nucleus accumbens play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (ad). The likely cause is an increase in the toxic form of β-amyloid in the brain. Like other pathogenetic processes in AD, this impairment may be mediated by an increase in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of β-amyloid on dopamine release in the shell of the nucleus accumbens. Changes in the dopamine level in the shell of the nucleus accumbens were recorded in vivo in 38 anesthetized male Wistar rats by fast scan cyclic voltammetry before and 1.5 h after experimental treatment. The ability of dopaminergic neurons to secrete dopamine was assessed in terms of the amplitude of responses to electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurotoxic processes typical of AD were modeled by giving β-amyloid (fragment 25–35) solution into the ventricular system of the brain. The role of GSK34 in mediating the effects of β-amyloid were evaluated by blocking the activity of this enzyme with an inhibitor, i.e., lithium. Lithium chloride solution at the “therapeutic” dose of 10.4 mg/kg was given i.p. immediately after β-amyloid injections. Increases in stimulated dopamine release provided evidence that during the 1.5 h after administration of both β-amyloid and lithium, the ability of ventral tegmental area neurons to secret dopamine in the shell of the nucleus accumbens was increased. Furthermore, comparison with the control group showed that these substances countered weakening of the secretory function induced by the experimental conditions. Lithium given simultaneously with β-amyloid weakened its action, evidencing involvement of GSK3 in this process.","V. N. Mukhin, I. R. Borovets, ... V. M. Klimenko",2021-02-18
"Effects of test experience, closed-arm wall color, and illumination level on behavior and plasma corticosterone response in an elevated plus maze in male C57BL/6J mice: a challenge against conventional interpretation of the test",/article/10.1186/s13041-020-00721-2,"The elevated plus maze test is a widely used test for assessing anxiety-like behavior and screening novel therapeutic agents in rodents. Previous studies have shown that a variety of internal factors and procedural variables can influence elevated plus maze behavior. Although some studies have suggested a link between behavior and plasma corticosterone levels, the relationships between them remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of experience with a battery of behavioral tests, the wall color of the closed arms, and illumination level on the behavior and plasma corticosterone responses in the elevated plus maze in male C57BL/6J mice. Mice were either subjected to a series of behavioral tests, including assessments of general health and neurological function, a light/dark transition test, and an open field test, or left undisturbed until the start of the elevated plus maze test. The mice with and without test battery experience were allowed to freely explore the elevated plus maze. The other two independent groups of naïve mice were tested in mazes with closed arms with different wall colors (clear, transparent blue, white, and black) or different illumination levels (5, 100, and 800 lx). Immediately after the test, blood was collected to measure plasma corticosterone concentrations. Mice with test battery experience showed a lower percentage of open arm time and entries and, somewhat paradoxically, had lower plasma corticosterone levels than the mice with no test battery experience. Mice tested in the maze with closed arms with clear walls exhibited higher open arm exploration than mice tested in the maze with closed arms with black walls, while there were no significant differences in plasma corticosterone levels between the different wall color conditions. Illumination levels had no significant effects on any measure. Our results indicate that experience with other behavioral tests and different physical features of the maze affect elevated plus maze behaviors. Increased open arm time and entries are conventionally interpreted as decreased anxiety-like behavior, while other possible interpretations are considered: open arm exploration may reflect heightened anxiety and panic-like reaction to a novel situation under certain conditions. With the possibility of different interpretations, the present findings highlight the need to carefully consider the test conditions in designing experiments and drawing conclusions from the behavioral outcomes in the elevated plus maze test in C57BL/6J mice.","Hirotaka Shoji, Tsuyoshi Miyakawa",2021-02-15
Stress and Individual Development,/article/10.1007/s11055-023-01390-z,"This review addresses the state of stress in relation to individual development, in particular, as a characteristic of the initial stages of the formation of new adaptations in the process of human and animal ontogeny in normal and “pathological” conditions. Arguments are given in favor of regarding stress as a process of reversible dedifferentiation, i.e., one reducing the complexity of actualized individual experience. This implies temporary regression, which decreases the contribution of systems of relatively highly differentiated, complex behavior to maintenance of the individual’s current activity, which, under certain conditions, ensures an increase in the efficiency of the formation of behavior. Phenomenologically, stress regression is described as a “return” to forms of interaction with the environment formed at previous stages of development. We review data from our own and published experiments obtained from analysis of these processes in humans and animals at the behavioral level during recording of changes in visceral and neuronal activity (spike and molecular genetic activity). This leads to the formulation of empirically substantiated conclusions regarding the mechanisms and significance of dedifferentiation (and other associated system processes) during acute stress and how the system dynamics of stress change during its chronic course, including in illness.","Yu.

Different techniques for Alzheimer’s disease classification using brain images: a study,/article/10.1007/s13735-021-00210-9,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a kind of dementia that is mostly experienced by people who are in the age of early 60s. In AD, brain cells that are responsible for forming memories and cognitive decisions, get affected which causes overall gray matter shrinkage in the human brain. Since AD patients are growing exponentially in the world, researchers are trying to develop an accurate mechanism for diagnosing the disease using brain images. In this paper, several research articles on AD classification are analyzed along with detailed observations. We have summarized as well as compared the research articles based on their classification performance. Although all the reviewed articles have the potential to classify AD, still there lies major future challenges. Among all the reviewed papers, it is found that the recent deep neural network-based classification techniques can produce the most promising results with an average performance rate of 93%.","Ruhul Amin Hazarika, Ajith Abraham, ...

Reservoir weights learning based on adaptive dynamic programming and its application in time series classification,/article/10.1007/s00521-021-06827-5,"Time series classification (TSC) has been addressed and analysed through a wide spectrum of algorithms. Nevertheless, few have considered the notion of spiking or non-spiking neural networks (NNs) and their performance in TSC tasks. Seminal Reservoir Computing (s-RC) with random connected recurrent neural networks is categorized among the fastest and most efficient end-to-end NNs that have been applied to TSC problems. Although the s-RC architecture is absolutely suited for dynamic (temporal) data processing, it fails to achieve significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art fully trainable NNs. Along this thread, the present study proposes a novel algorithm for training the reservoir by fusing nonlinear optimal control theory with reservoir computing (RC) theory, which opens a new approach to optimizing RC predicted values (estimated class) in a specific timestamp along the desired trajectory (true class). For this purpose, TSC tasks were reformulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, conducive to an approximate solution to a learning rule for the reservoir of spiking or non-spiking neurons, using the adaptive/approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method. The proposed framework that known as Trainable Reservoir Computing (t-RC) involves an online actor–critic method which is used to project the effect of the output error into the reservoir’s parameters adjusting rule so as to ensure the classification error is minimized. To evaluate the TSC adaptability of the newly proposed RC framework and state-of-the-art NN-based methods, varying experiments on 22 univariate and multivariate time series datasets (UCR and UEA datasets) were performed. The findings divulge that the proposed framework outperforms other RC methods in learning capacity and accuracy and attains classification accuracy comparable with the best fully trainable deep neural networks.","Mohammad Modiri, Mohammad Mehdi Homayounpour, Mohammad Mehdi Ebadzadeh",2022-01-27
A Text Mining Pipeline Using Active and Deep Learning Aimed at Curating Information in Computational Neuroscience,/article/10.1007/s12021-018-9404-y,"The curation of neuroscience entities is crucial to ongoing efforts in neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience, such as those being deployed in the context of continuing large-scale brain modelling projects. However, manually sifting through thousands of articles for new information about modelled entities is a painstaking and low-reward task. Text mining can be used to help a curator extract relevant information from this literature in a systematic way. We propose the application of text mining methods for the neuroscience literature. Specifically, two computational neuroscientists annotated a corpus of entities pertinent to neuroscience using active learning techniques to enable swift, targeted annotation. We then trained machine learning models to recognise the entities that have been identified. The entities covered are Neuron Types, Brain Regions, Experimental Values, Units, Ion Currents, Channels, and Conductances and Model organisms. We tested a traditional rule-based approach, a conditional random field and a model using deep learning named entity recognition, finding that the deep learning model was superior. Our final results show that we can detect a range of named entities of interest to the neuroscientist with a macro average precision, recall and F1 score of 0.866, 0.817 and 0.837 respectively. The contributions of this work are as follows: 1) We provide a set of Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools that are capable of detecting neuroscience entities with performance above or similar to prior work. 2) We propose a methodology for training NER tools for neuroscience that requires very little training data to get strong performance. This can be adapted for any sub-domain within neuroscience. 3) We provide a small corpus with annotations for multiple entity types, as well as annotation guidelines to help others reproduce our experiments.","Matthew Shardlow, Meizhi Ju, ...

Whole-cortex mapping of common genetic influences on depression and a social deficits dimension,/article/10.1038/s41398-019-0611-6,"Social processes are associated with depression, particularly understanding and responding to others, deficits in which can manifest as callousness/unemotionality (CU). Thus, CU may reflect some of the genetic risk to depression. Further, this vulnerability likely reflects the neurological substrates of depression, presenting biomarkers to capture genetic vulnerability of depression severity. However, heritability varies within brain regions, so a high-resolution genetic perspective is needed. We developed a toolbox that maps genetic and environmental associations between brain and behavior at high resolution. We used this toolbox to estimate brain areas that are genetically associated with both depressive symptoms and CU in a sample of 258 same-sex twin pairs from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study (LTS). We then overlapped the two maps to generate coordinates that allow for tests of downstream effects of genes influencing our clusters. Genetic variance influencing cortical thickness in the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) sulci and gyri, ventral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), pre-somatic motor cortex (PreSMA), medial precuneus, left occipital-temporal junction (OTJ), parietal–temporal junction (PTJ), ventral somatosensory cortex (vSMA), and medial and lateral precuneus were genetically associated with both depression and CU. Split-half replication found support for both DLPFC clusters. Meta-analytic term search identified “theory of mind”, “inhibit”, and “pain” as likely functions. Gene and transcript mapping/enrichment analyses implicated calcium channels. CU reflects genetic vulnerability to depression that likely involves executive and social functioning in a distributed process across the cortex. This approach works to unify neuroimaging, neuroinformatics, and genetics to discover pathways to psychiatric vulnerability.","Alexander S. Hatoum, Andrew E. Reineberg, ... Naomi P.

"Standardizing digital biobanks: integrating imaging, genomic, and clinical data for precision medicine",/article/10.1186/s12967-024-04891-8,"Advancements in data acquisition and computational methods are generating a large amount of heterogeneous biomedical data from diagnostic domains such as clinical imaging, pathology, and next-generation sequencing (NGS), which help characterize individual differences in patients. However, this information needs to be available and suitable to promote and support scientific research and technological development, supporting the effective adoption of the precision medicine approach in clinical practice. Digital biobanks can catalyze this process, facilitating the sharing of curated and standardized imaging data, clinical, pathological and molecular data, crucial to enable the development of a comprehensive and personalized data-driven diagnostic approach in disease management and fostering the development of computational predictive models. This work aims to frame this perspective, first by evaluating the state of standardization of individual diagnostic domains and then by identifying challenges and proposing a possible solution towards an integrative approach that can guarantee the suitability of information that can be shared through a digital biobank. Our analysis of the state of the art shows the presence and use of reference standards in biobanks and, generally, digital repositories for each specific domain. Despite this, standardization to guarantee the integration and reproducibility of the numerical descriptors generated by each domain, e.g. radiomic, pathomic and -omic features, is still an open challenge. Based on specific use cases and scenarios, an integration model, based on the JSON format, is proposed that can help address this problem. Ultimately, this work shows how, with specific standardization and promotion efforts, the digital biobank model can become an enabling technology for the comprehensive study of diseases and the effective development of data-driven technologies at the service of precision medicine.","Valentina Brancato, Giuseppina Esposito, ...

Human-machine-learning integration and task allocation in citizen science,/article/10.1057/s41599-022-01049-z,"The field of citizen science involves the participation of citizens across different stages of a scientific project; within this field there is currently a rapid expansion of the integration of humans and AI computational technologies based on machine learning and/or neural networking-based paradigms. The distribution of tasks between citizens (“the crowd”), experts, and this type of technologies has received relatively little attention. To illustrate the current state of task allocation in citizen science projects that integrate humans and computational technologies, an integrative literature review of 50 peer-reviewed papers was conducted. A framework was used for characterizing citizen science projects based on two main dimensions: (a) the nature of the task outsourced to the crowd, and (b) the skills required by the crowd to perform a task. The framework was extended to include tasks performed by experts and AI computational technologies as well. Most of the tasks citizens do in the reported projects are well-structured, involve little interdependence, and require skills prevalent among the general population. The work of experts is typically structured and at a higher-level of interdependence than that of citizens, requiring expertize in specific fields. Unsurprisingly, AI computational technologies are capable of performing mostly well-structured tasks at a high-level of interdependence. It is argued that the distribution of tasks that results from the combination of computation and citizen science may disincentivize certain volunteer groups. Assigning tasks in a meaningful way to citizen scientists alongside experts and AI computational technologies is an unavoidable design challenge.","Marisa Ponti, Alena Seredko",2022-02-09

Jumping over baselines with new methods to predict activation maps from resting-state fMRI,/article/10.1038/s41598-021-82681-8,"Cognitive fMRI research primarily relies on task-averaged responses over many subjects to describe general principles of brain function. Nonetheless, there exists a large variability between subjects that is also reflected in spontaneous brain activity as measured by resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). Leveraging this fact, several recent studies have therefore aimed at predicting task activation from rsfMRI using various machine learning methods within a growing literature on ‘connectome fingerprinting’. In reviewing these results, we found lack of an evaluation against robust baselines that reliably supports a novelty of predictions for this task. On closer examination to reported methods, we found most underperform against trivial baseline model performances based on massive group averaging when whole-cortex prediction is considered. Here we present a modification to published methods that remedies this problem to large extent. Our proposed modification is based on a single-vertex approach that replaces commonly used brain parcellations. We further provide a summary of this model evaluation by characterizing empirical properties of where prediction for this task appears possible, explaining why some predictions largely fail for certain targets. Finally, with these empirical observations we investigate whether individual prediction scores explain individual behavioral differences in a task.","Eric Lacosse, Klaus Scheffler, ...

Synchronization in a Network of Spiking Neural Oscillators with Plastic Connectivity,/article/10.1007/s11141-021-10054-2,"Synchronization of neural activity plays an important role for processing of information in the brain. In this work, we study the dynamics of a neural network with plastic synaptic connections under the action of a spatially localized stimulus. It is established that synchronization of all the network neurons by a local action is possible in a certain range of periodic stimulation. The network forms the signals in the form of quasi-synchronous bursts of pulses and synchronization of the bursts with the applied stimuli occurs under an external periodic action. It is shown that the network synchronization takes place in a certain frequency range of external action. An extension of this range is observed with increasing geometric size of the stimulated region. The synchronization range decreases with increasing number of the neuron connections in the network. It is also established that the plastic (adaptive) connections among the elements of the network can improve its sensitivity to external action, i.e., extend the frequency range of stimulation which causes the network synchronization, and decrease the minimum size of the network segment exposed to external action.","M.

Building FAIR Functionality: Annotating Events in Time Series Data Using Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED),/article/10.1007/s12021-021-09537-4,"Human electrophysiological and related time series data are often acquired in complex, event-rich environments. However, the resulting recorded brain or other dynamics are often interpreted in relation to more sparsely recorded or subsequently-noted events. Currently a substantial gap exists between the level of event description required by current digital data archiving standards and the level of annotation required for successful analysis of event-related data across studies, environments, and laboratories. Manifold challenges must be addressed, most prominently ontological clarity, vocabulary extensibility, annotation tool availability, and overall usability, to allow and promote sharing of data with an effective level of descriptive detail for labeled events. Motivating data authors to perform the work needed to adequately annotate their data is a key challenge.

We recap the evolution of HED and its acceptance by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) movement, describe the recent release of HED-3G, a third generation HED tools and design framework, and discuss directions for future development.

Active Asteroid-SLAM,/article/10.1007/s10846-019-01103-0,"In this paper, we propose an active real-time capable 3D graph based simultaneous localization and mapping (Graph SLAM) approach, which actively estimates the state of an autonomous spacecraft relative to a simultaneously established map estimate. The graph is constructed in a tightly-coupled fashion, where an Extended Kalman Filter estimates the relative offset between two of its vertices. An additional relative measurement is derived by matching point clouds obtained by a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system. In order to yield a significant speed-up, scan matching is implemented on the GPU. To reduce the uncertainty of either the state or the map estimate, we present an approach to actively control the system resting on an extended representation of uncertainty in the map. Furthermore, it adapts its behavior depending on the current uncertainty distribution in order to find a dynamic trade-off between exploitation (improve localization performance) and exploration (improve knowledge about the environment). Finally, we present a post-processing approach to discover landing sites in the map estimate without prior knowledge. The evaluation is conducted in a numerical simulation, where the spacecraft explores the real 3D model of Itokawa in its actual dynamic environment. Within that simulation, we use a shader-based GPU implementation for simulating LiDAR measurements. We evaluate the performance of the active SLAM approach and demonstrate that the use of the adaptive approach improves navigation and exploration performance at the same time.","David Nakath, Joachim Clemens, Carsten Rachuy",2019-11-16

Rats who develop CLD early in life displayed pronounced neurometabolic changes in the hippocampus characterized by a progressive increase in glutamine concentration which correlated with plasma ammonia levels and a rapid decrease in brain myo-inositol. Other neurometabolic findings included a decrease in other organic osmolytes (taurine, choline-containing compounds and creatine), ascorbate and glutamate. At the cellular level, we observed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) expression in the hippocampus at 4 weeks post bile duct ligation (BDL), together with astrocytic morphological alterations. These findings differ from observations in the brain of adult rats following BDL, and are in keeping with the commonly accepted theory of age-dependent vulnerability.","Veronika Rackayova, Olivier Braissant, ...

Overcoming false-positive gene-category enrichment in the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomic brain atlas data,/article/10.1038/s41467-021-22862-1,"Transcriptomic atlases have improved our understanding of the correlations between gene-expression patterns and spatially varying properties of brain structure and function. Gene-category enrichment analysis (GCEA) is a common method to identify functional gene categories that drive these associations, using gene-to-category annotation systems like the Gene Ontology (GO). Here, we show that applying standard GCEA methodology to spatial transcriptomic data is affected by substantial false-positive bias, with GO categories displaying an over 500-fold average inflation of false-positive associations with random neural phenotypes in mouse and human. The estimated false-positive rate of a GO category is associated with its rate of being reported as significantly enriched in the literature, suggesting that published reports are affected by this false-positive bias. We show that within-category gene–gene coexpression and spatial autocorrelation are key drivers of the false-positive bias and introduce flexible ensemble-based null models that can account for these effects, made available as a software toolbox.","Ben D.

A community-based transcriptomics classification and nomenclature of neocortical cell types,/article/10.1038/s41593-020-0685-8,"To understand the function of cortical circuits, it is necessary to catalog their cellular diversity. Past attempts to do so using anatomical, physiological or molecular features of cortical cells have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neuronal or glial cell types, partly due to limited data. Single-cell transcriptomics is enabling, for the first time, systematic high-throughput measurements of cortical cells and generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and permanent. Statistical analyses of these data reveal clusters that often correspond to cell types previously defined by morphological or physiological criteria and that appear conserved across cortical areas and species. To capitalize on these new methods, we propose the adoption of a transcriptome-based taxonomy of cell types for mammalian neocortex. This classification should be hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It should be based on a probabilistic definition of a cell type and incorporate data from different approaches, developmental stages and species. A community-based classification and data aggregation model, such as a knowledge graph, could provide a common foundation for the study of cortical circuits. This community-based classification, nomenclature and data aggregation could serve as an example for cell type atlases in other parts of the body.","Rafael Yuste, Michael Hawrylycz, ...

These networks operate with data at a higher level. Unlabeled data can be used to pretrain the network, i.e., there is no need for an expert to determine in advance the phenomenon to which these data correspond. Final training requires a small amount of labeled data. Deep networks have a higher level of abstraction and produce fewer errors. The same network can be used to solve several tasks at the same time, or it is easy to retrain it from one task to another.

"Biophysical neurons, energy, and synapse controllability: a review",/article/10.1631/jzus.A2200469,"Diffusive intracellular and extracellular ions induce a gradient electromagnetic field that regulates membrane potential, and energy injection from external stimuli breaks the energy balance between the magnetic and electric fields in a cell. Indeed, any activation of biophysical function and self-adaption of biological neurons may be dependent on energy flow, and synapse connection is controlled to reach energy balance between neurons. When more neurons are clustered and gathered closely, field energy is exchanged and shape formation is induced to achieve local energy balance. As a result, the coexistence of multiple firing modes in neural activities is fostered to prevent the occurrence of bursting synchronization and seizure. In this review, a variety of biophysical neuron models are presented and explained in terms of their physical aspects, and the controllability of functional synapses, formation of heterogeneity, and defects are clarified for knowing the synchronization stability and cooperation between functional regions. These models and findings are summarized to provide new insights into nonlinear physics and computational neuroscience.",Jun Ma,2022-12-23
Uncovering today’s rationalistic attunement,/article/10.1007/s11097-021-09728-z,"In this paper, we explore a rationalistic orientation in Western society. We suggest that this orientation is one of the predominant ways in which Western society tends to frame, understand and deal with a majority of problems and questions – namely in terms of mathematical analysis, calculation and quantification, relying on logic, numbers, and statistics. Our main goal in this paper is to uncover the affective structure of this rationalistic orientation. In doing so, we illustrate how this orientation structures the way not only individuals but society as a whole frames and solves problems. We firstly point towards some exemplary instances of the rationalistic orientation, specifically regarding science, society, and lifeworld practice. Crucially, we argue that the rationalistic orientation is not merely based on a set of beliefs we could easily correct; but rather, that it is an affective condition tacitly shaping our engagement with the world in an encompassing way. Relating to the work of Martin Heidegger, we argue that what we have called an orientation in the beginning is in fact a rationalistic attunement. This attunement fundamentally shapes the pre-reflective level of how individuals approach the world. We elaborate this claim by showing how the rationalistic attunement concretely manifests in tangible socio-material affect dynamics. In the end, we motivate a critical stance towards this attunement, providing the ability to reflect upon and question instances where this way of framing and solving problems is counterproductive.","Paul Schuetze, Imke von Maur",2021-02-10
Brainstem atrophy in the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease: a voxel-based morphometry study,/article/10.1007/s11682-019-00231-3,"Postmortem studies on patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have confirmed that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the brainstem is the first brain structure affected in the earliest stage of AD. The present study examined the brainstem in the early stage of AD using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. T1-weighted MR images of the brains of 81 subjects were obtained from the publicly available Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database, including 27 normal control (NC) subjects, 27 patients with very mild AD (AD-VM) and 27 patients with mild AD (AD-M). The brainstem was interactively segmented from the MR images using ITK-SNAP. The present voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study was designed to investigate the brainstem differences between the AD-VM/AD-M groups and the NC group. The results showed bilateral loss in the pons and the left part of the midbrain in the AD-M group compared to the NC group. The AD-M group showed greater loss in the left midbrain than the AD-VM group (PFWEcorrected < 0.05). The results revealed that brainstem atrophy occurs in the early stages of AD (Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5 and 1.0). Most of these findings were also investigated in a multicenter dataset. This is the first VBM study that provides evidence of brainstem alterations in the early stage of AD.","Xiaoxi Ji, Hui Wang, ... Yili Fu",2020-01-02
Application of Deep Learning Method on Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation,/article/10.1007/s12204-021-2273-9,"Although deep learning methods have been widely applied in medical image lesion segmentation, it is still challenging to apply it for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions, which are different from brain tumors in lesion characteristics, segmentation difficulty, algorithm maturity, and segmentation accuracy. Three main stages are used to describe the manifestations of stroke. For acute ischemic stroke, the size of the lesions is similar to that of the brain tumor, and the current deep learning methods have been able to achieve a high segmentation accuracy. For sub-acute and chronic ischemic stroke, the segmentation results of mainstream deep learning algorithms are still unsatisfactory as lesions in these stages are small and diffuse. By using three scientific search engines including CNKI, Web of Science and Google Scholar, this paper aims to comprehensively understand the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms applied to segment ischemic stroke lesions. For the first time, this paper discusses the current situation, challenges, and development directions of deep learning algorithms applied to ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in different stages. In the future, a system that can directly identify different stroke stages and automatically select the suitable network architecture for the stroke lesion segmentation needs to be proposed.","Yue Zhang, Shijie Liu, ...

Atlas-Based Classification Algorithms for Identification of Informative Brain Regions in fMRI Data,/article/10.1007/s12021-019-09435-w,"Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has been successfully applied to neuroimaging data due to its larger sensitivity compared to univariate traditional techniques. Searchlight is the most widely employed approach to assign functional value to different regions of the brain. However, its performance depends on the size of the sphere, which can overestimate the region of activation when a large sphere size is employed. In the current study, we examined the validity of two different alternatives to Searchlight: an atlas-based local averaging method (ABLA, Schrouff et al. Neuroinformatics 16, 117–143, 2013a) and a Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL, Rakotomamonjy et al. Journal of Machine Learning 9, 2491–2521, 2008) approach, in a scenario where the goal is to find the informative brain regions that support certain mental operations. These methods employ weights to measure the informativeness of a brain region and highly reduce the large computational cost that Searchlight entails. We evaluated their performance in two different scenarios where the differential BOLD activation between experimental conditions was large vs. small, and employed nine different atlases to assess the influence of diverse brain parcellations. Results show that both methods were able to localize informative regions when differences between conditions were large, demonstrating a large sensitivity and stability in the identification of regions across atlases. Moreover, the sign of the weights reported by these methods provided the directionality of univariate approaches. However, when differences were small, only ABLA localized informative regions. Thus, our results show that atlas-based methods are useful alternatives to Searchlight, but that the nature of the classification to perform should be taken into account when choosing the specific method to implement.","Juan E.

Evaluation of dual energy CT and iterative metal artefact reduction (iMAR) for artefact reduction in radiation therapy,/article/10.1007/s13246-019-00801-1,"Metal artefacts pose a common problem in single energy computed tomography (SECT) images used for radiotherapy. Virtual monoenergetic (VME) images constructed with dual energy computed tomography (DECT) scans can be used to reduce beam hardening artefacts. Dual energy metal artefact reduction is compared and combined with iterative metal artefact reduction (iMAR) to determine optimal imaging strategies for patients with metal prostheses. SECT and DECT scans were performed on a Siemens Somatom AS-64 Slice CT scanner. Images were acquired of a modified CIRS pelvis phantom with 6, 12, 20 mm diameter stainless steel rods and VME images reconstructed at 100, 120, 140 and 190 keV. These were post-reconstructed with and without the iMAR algorithm. Artefact reduction was measured using: (1) the change in Hounsfield Unit (HU) with and without metal artefact reduction (MAR) for 4 regions of interest; (2) the total number of artefact pixels, defined as pixels with a difference (between images with metal rod and without) exceeding a threshold; (3) the difference in the mean pixel intensity of the artefact pixels. DECT, SECT + iMAR and DECT + iMAR were compared. Both SECT + iMAR and DECT + iMAR offer successful MAR for phantom simulating unilateral hip prosthesis. DECT gives minimal artefact reduction over iMAR alone. Quantitative metrics are advantageous for MAR analysis but have limitations that leave room for metric development.","P. Lim, J. Barber, J.

Native non-prototypicality in vowel perception induces prominent neuromagnetic mismatch intensities in non-native speakers: a pilot study,/article/10.1007/s00221-020-05996-4,"Neural mismatch response resulting from the difference between prediction and observation is related to change detection and discrimination. Robust neuromagnetic brain activity of auditory mismatch-related perception occurs in response to non-prototypical vowels in across-category contrasts for first-language speakers. However, whether this non-prototypicality effect applies to within-category vowel perception remains to be elucidated. Here, healthy Japanese adults (n = 7) were subjected to magnetoencephalography (MEG) while watching a silent movie, and passively listened to synthesized English vowels /i/. We observed the source-level mismatch effect to the mid-high near-front vowel deviant [ɪ] with the most non-prototypical, unspecified feature in the participants’ native language system. The mismatch effect recruited the left posterior superior temporal sulcus with a peak latency of 225 ms post-stimulus onset. We further studied whether a longer F1 distance between vowel pairs would increase mismatch-activated intensities, however, we did not observe neuromagnetic changes when the prototypical anchor standard [i] was compared with three non-prototypical deviants differing in first resonance frequency (F1) values. Our results indicate that an F1 increase in within-category upper front vowel perception is a strong activator of mismatch responses measured by source-level activated intensities for non-native listeners.","Mikio Kubota, Junko Matsuzaki, ...

"Towards an Architecture of a Multi-purpose, User-Extendable Reference Human Brain Atlas",/article/10.1007/s12021-021-09555-2,"Human brain atlas development is predominantly research-oriented and the use of atlases in clinical practice is limited. Here I introduce a new definition of a reference human brain atlas that serves education, research and clinical applications, and is extendable by its user. Subsequently, an architecture of a multi-purpose, user-extendable reference human brain atlas is proposed and its implementation discussed. The human brain atlas is defined as a vehicle to gather, present, use, share, and discover knowledge about the human brain with highly organized content, tools enabling a wide range of its applications, massive and heterogeneous knowledge database, and means for content and knowledge growing by its users. The proposed architecture determines major components of the atlas, their mutual relationships, and functional roles. It contains four functional units, core cerebral models, knowledge database, research and clinical data input and conversion, and toolkit (supporting processing, content extension, atlas individualization, navigation, exploration, and display), all united by a user interface. Each unit is described in terms of its function, component modules and sub-modules, data handling, and implementation aspects. This novel architecture supports brain knowledge gathering, presentation, use, sharing, and discovery and is broadly applicable and useful in student- and educator-oriented neuroeducation for knowledge presentation and communication, research for knowledge acquisition, aggregation and discovery, and clinical applications in decision making support for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and prediction. It establishes a backbone for designing and developing new, multi-purpose and user-extendable brain atlas platforms, serving as a potential standard across labs, hospitals, and medical schools.",Wieslaw L.

Local syntactic violations evoke fast mismatch-related neural activity detected by optical neuroimaging,/article/10.1007/s00221-020-05922-8,"It remains to be investigated whether syntax-related mismatch activity would be evoked in event-related optical signals by syntactic violations that deviate from our language knowledge and expectations. In the current study, we have employed fast optical neuroimaging with a frequency-domain oximeter to examine whether syntactic violations of English bare infinitives in the non-finite complement clause would trigger syntax-related mismatch effects. Recorded sentences of bare or full infinitive structures (without or with the ‘to’ infinitival marker) with syntactically correct or incorrect versions and non-syntactic lexical items (verbs) were presented to native speakers of English (n = 8) during silent movie viewing as a passive oddball task. The analysis of source strength (i.e., minimum norm current amplitudes) revealed that the syntactic category violations of bare object infinitives led to significantly more robust optical mismatch effects than the other syntactic violation and non-structural, lexical elements. This mismatch response had a peak latency of 186 ms in the left anterior superior temporal gyrus. In combination with our prior MEG report (Kubota et al. in Neurosci Lett 662:195–204, 2018), the present optical neuroimaging findings show that syntactic marking (unmarked-to-marked) violations of the bare object infinitive against the rule of the mental grammar enhance the signal strength exactly in the same manner seen with MEG scanning, including the peak latency of mismatch activity and the activated area of the brain.","Mikio Kubota, Luca Pollonini, George Zouridakis",2020-09-18
Folding drives cortical thickness variations,/article/10.1140/epjst/e2020-000001-6,"The cortical thickness is a characteristic biomarker for a wide variety of neurological disorders. While the structural organization of the cerebral cortex is tightly regulated and evolutionarily preserved, its thickness varies widely between 1.5 and 4.5 mm across the healthy adult human brain. It remains unclear whether these thickness variations are a cause or consequence of cortical development. Recent studies suggest that cortical thickness variations are primarily a result of genetic effects. Previous studies showed that a simple homogeneous bilayered system with a growing layer on an elastic substrate undergoes a unique symmetry breaking into a spatially heterogeneous system with discrete gyri and sulci. Here, we expand on that work to explore the evolution of cortical thickness variations over time to support our finding that cortical pattern formation and thickness variations can be explained – at least in part – by the physical forces that emerge during cortical folding. Strikingly, as growth progresses, the developing gyri universally thicken and the sulci thin, even in the complete absence of regional information. Using magnetic resonance images, we demonstrate that these naturally emerging thickness variations agree with the cortical folding pattern in n = 9 healthy adult human brains, in n = 564 healthy human brains ages 7–64, and in n = 73 infant brains scanned at birth, and at ages one and two. Additionally, we show that cortical organoids develop similar patterns throughout their growth. Our results suggest that genetic, geometric, and physical events during brain development are closely interrelated. Understanding regional and temporal variations in cortical thickness can provide insight into the evolution and causative factors of neurological disorders, inform the diagnosis of neurological conditions, and assess the efficacy of treatment options.","Maria A.

Replicability or reproducibility? On the replication crisis in computational neuroscience and sharing only relevant detail,/article/10.1007/s10827-018-0702-z,"Replicability and reproducibility of computational models has been somewhat understudied by “the replication movement.” In this paper, we draw on methodological studies into the replicability of psychological experiments and on the mechanistic account of explanation to analyze the functions of model replications and model reproductions in computational neuroscience. We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution. Reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.","Marcin Miłkowski, Witold M. Hensel, Mateusz Hohol",2018-10-31
Deep Learning Methods for Identification of White Matter Fiber Tracts: Review of State-of-the-Art and Future Prospective,/article/10.1007/s12021-023-09636-4,"Quantitative analysis of white matter fiber tracts from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data is of great significance in health and disease. For example, analysis of fiber tracts related to anatomically meaningful fiber bundles is highly demanded in pre-surgical and treatment planning, and the surgery outcome depends on accurate segmentation of the desired tracts. Currently, this process is mainly done through time-consuming manual identification performed by neuro-anatomical experts. However, there is a broad interest in automating the pipeline such that it is fast, accurate, and easy to apply in clinical settings and also eliminates the intra-reader variabilities. Following the advancements in medical image analysis using deep learning techniques, there has been a growing interest in using these techniques for the task of tract identification as well. Recent reports on this application show that deep learning-based tract identification approaches outperform existing state-of-the-art methods. This paper presents a review of current tract identification approaches based on deep neural networks. First, we review the recent deep learning methods for tract identification. Next, we compare them with respect to their performance, training process, and network properties.

Understanding emergent patterns in such networks is an ongoing effort with profound implications for different fields. In this work, we analytically and numerically study a symmetric ring of N coupled self-oscillators of van der Pol type under external stochastic forcing. The system is proposed as a model of the thermo- and aeroacoustic interactions of sound fields in rigid enclosures with compact source regions in a can-annular combustor. The oscillators are connected via linear resistive coupling with nonlinear saturation. After transforming the system to amplitude-phase coordinates, deterministic and stochastic averaging is performed to eliminate the fast oscillating terms. By projecting the potential of the slow-flow dynamics onto the phase-locked quasi-limit cycle solutions, we obtain a compact, low-order description of the (de-)synchronization transition for an arbitrary number of oscillators. The stationary probability density function of the state variables is derived from the Fokker–Planck equation, studied for varying parameter values and compared to time series simulations. We leverage our analysis to offer explanations for the intermittent energy transfer between Bloch waves observed in acoustic pressure spectrograms observed of real-world gas turbines.","Tiemo Pedergnana, Nicolas Noiray",2022-02-18

Mapping the community structure of the rat cerebral cortex with weighted stochastic block modeling,/article/10.1007/s00429-019-01984-9,"The anatomical architecture of the mammalian brain can be modeled as the connectivity between functionally distinct areas of cortex and sub-cortex, which we refer to as the connectome. The community structure of the connectome describes how the network can be parsed into meaningful groups of nodes. This process, called community detection, is commonly carried out to find internally densely connected communities—a modular topology. However, other community structure patterns are possible. Here we employ the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM), which can identify a wide range of topologies, to the rat cerebral cortex connectome, to probe the network for evidence of modular, core, periphery, and disassortative organization. Despite its algorithmic flexibility, the WSBM identifies substantial modular and assortative topology throughout the rat cerebral cortex connectome, significantly aligning to the modular approach in some parts of the network. Significant deviations from modular partitions include the identification of communities that are highly enriched in core (rich club) areas. A comparison of the WSBM and modular models demonstrates that the former, when applied as a generative model, more closely captures several nodal network attributes. An analysis of variation across an ensemble of partitions reveals that certain parts of the network participate in multiple topological regimes. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential benefits of adopting the WSBM, which can be applied to a single weighted and directed matrix such as the rat cerebral cortex connectome, to identify community structure with a broad definition that transcends the common modular approach.","Joshua Faskowitz, Olaf Sporns",2019-11-23

Automated Metadata Suggestion During Repository Submission,/article/10.1007/s12021-018-9403-z,"Knowledge discovery via an informatics resource is constrained by the completeness of the resource, both in terms of the amount of data it contains and in terms of the metadata that exists to describe the data. Increasing completeness in one of these categories risks reducing completeness in the other because manually curating metadata is time consuming and is restricted by familiarity with both the data and the metadata annotation scheme. The diverse interests of a research community may drive a resource to have hundreds of metadata tags with few examples for each making it challenging for humans or machine learning algorithms to learn how to assign metadata tags properly. We demonstrate with ModelDB, a computational neuroscience model discovery resource, that using manually-curated regular-expression based rules can overcome this challenge by parsing existing texts from data providers during user data entry to suggest metadata annotations and prompt them to suggest other related metadata annotations rather than leaving the task to a curator. In the ModelDB implementation, analyzing the abstract identified 6.4 metadata tags per abstract at 79% precision. Using the full-text produced higher recall with low precision (41%), and the title alone produced few (1.3) metadata annotations per entry; we thus recommend data providers use their abstract during upload. Grouping the possible metadata annotations into categories (e.g. cell type, biological topic) revealed that precision and recall for the different text sources varies by category. Given this proof-of-concept, other bioinformatics resources can likewise improve the quality of their metadata by adopting our approach of prompting data uploaders with relevant metadata at the minimal cost of formalizing rules for each potential metadata annotation.","Robert A.

Chronic electrical stimulation induces functional network changes in cortical neuron cultures,/article/10.1007/s11431-019-1442-2,"Recent studies demonstrated that a functional brain network could be regarded as a complex network. With the help of network theory, neuroscientists can identify common organizational principles of the functional brain networks. As a consequence, some non-random organizational features, such as “small world” (most of the nodes are not connected directly but can communicate with few intermediate relay steps) and “rich club” (nodes that are rich in connections tend to form strongly interconnected clubs), have been found in functional brain network. Recently, the “small world” organizational feature of neuronal functional networks in vitro was found to be influenced by external applications. However, little is known about the influence of chronic electrical stimulation on functional networks of dissociated cortical cultures during network development. In the present study, cortical cultures were electrically stimulated at a frequency of 0, 0.02, and 0.2 Hz, between 7 and 26 days in vitro (DIV). The spontaneous activity of the cortical cultures was recorded using MEAs. Next, a cross-covariance method and graph theory were applied to investigate organizational feature of functional networks. Our results showed that over 3 weeks of stimulation, the network density significantly increased with maturation in the control and 0.02 Hz stimulation groups, but not in 0.2 Hz stimulation groups. Moreover, all the cultures had a small-world topology at 14, 18, 22, and 26 DIV, free from the effect of chronic electrical stimulation. Besides, we found an asymmetry effect that partial electrical stimulation inhibited the formation of node connections in stimulated areas. This effect was more pronounced at 0.2 Hz than at 0.02 Hz stimulation. Our results suggest that electrical stimulation does not affect the small-world properties of neural cultures. Instead, electrical stimulation modulates connectivity patterns, and neurons within the stimulated area are less connected than neurons outside the stimulated area.","SongFang Wu, LuBin Wang, ...

"The open diffusion data derivatives, brain data upcycling via integrated publishing of derivatives and reproducible open cloud services",/article/10.1038/s41597-019-0073-y,"We describe the Open Diffusion Data Derivatives (O3D) repository: an integrated collection of preserved brain data derivatives and processing pipelines, published together using a single digital-object-identifier. The data derivatives were generated using modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data (dMRI) with diverse properties of resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to the data, we publish all processing pipelines (also referred to as open cloud services). The pipelines utilize modern methods for neuroimaging data processing (diffusion-signal modelling, fiber tracking, tractography evaluation, white matter segmentation, and structural connectome construction). The O3D open services can allow cognitive and clinical neuroscientists to run the connectome mapping algorithms on new, user-uploaded, data. Open source code implementing all O3D services is also provided to allow computational and computer scientists to reuse and extend the processing methods. Publishing both data-derivatives and integrated processing pipeline promotes practices for scientific reproducibility and data upcycling by providing open access to the research assets for utilization by multiple scientific communities.","Paolo Avesani, Brent McPherson, ...

Knowledge discovery from a more than a decade studies on healthcare Big Data systems: a scientometrics study,/article/10.1186/s40537-018-0167-y,"Annually, lots of research papers are published in scientific journals around the world. The knowledge of the status of research is a prerequisite for research planning and policy making. This type of knowledge could be gained through a scientometrics study on the published literature that analyzes research products in a scientific field. Always healthcare was a permanent concern of researchers and also rapidly expanding field of Big Data analytics has started to play a pivotal role in the evolution of healthcare practices and research. It leads attracting attention from academia, industry and even governments around the world to “Big data in Healthcare”. Therefore, this paper has done a meta-analysis on published researches methodology in this field in the period of 2008–2018. Statistical finding shows the “Meta-analysis and evidence” is the most used methodology in published papers. We applied data mining techniques for predicting using methodologies in the various databases to achieving knowledge discovery in the field. Naïve Bayes classifier in RapidMiner has been applied and results show eight main categories for words used in papers while “Developing methods to evaluate of care” averagely is the most intended using methodology for publishing papers and “Agent-based modeling” in nature is most using methodology and could be better predicted.","Fatemeh Soleimani-Roozbahani, Ali Rajabzadeh Ghatari, Reza Radfar",2019-01-31

Quantitative firing pattern phenotyping of hippocampal neuron types,/article/10.1038/s41598-019-52611-w,"Systematically organizing the anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties of cortical neurons is important for understanding their computational functions. Hippocampome.org defines 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation based on their somatic, axonal, and dendritic locations, putative excitatory/inhibitory outputs, molecular marker expression, and biophysical properties. We augmented the electrophysiological data of this knowledge base by collecting, quantifying, and analyzing the firing responses to depolarizing current injections for every hippocampal neuron type from published experiments. We designed and implemented objective protocols to classify firing patterns based on 5 transients (delay, adapting spiking, rapidly adapting spiking, transient stuttering, and transient slow-wave bursting) and 4 steady states (non-adapting spiking, persistent stuttering, persistent slow-wave bursting, and silence). This automated approach revealed 9 unique (plus one spurious) families of firing pattern phenotypes while distinguishing potential new neuronal subtypes. Novel statistical associations emerged between firing responses and other electrophysiological properties, morphological features, and molecular marker expression. The firing pattern parameters, experimental conditions, spike times, references to the original empirical evidences, and analysis scripts are released open-source through Hippocampome.org for all neuron types, greatly enhancing the existing search and browse capabilities. This information, collated online in human- and machine-accessible form, will help design and interpret both experiments and model simulations.","Alexander O. Komendantov, Siva Venkadesh, ...

Machine Learning in Lung Cancer Radiomics,/article/10.1007/s11633-022-1364-x,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Medical imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are routinely used for non-invasive lung cancer diagnosis. In clinical practice, physicians investigate the characteristics of tumors such as the size, shape and location from CT and PET images to make decisions. Recently, scientists have proposed various computational image features that can capture more information than that directly perceivable by human eyes, which promotes the rise of radiomics. Radiomics is a research field on the conversion of medical images into high-dimensional features with data-driven methods to help subsequent data mining for better clinical decision support. Radiomic analysis has four major steps: image preprocessing, tumor segmentation, feature extraction and clinical prediction. Machine learning, including the high-profile deep learning, facilitates the development and application of radiomic methods. Various radiomic methods have been proposed recently, such as the construction of radiomic signatures, tumor habitat analysis, cluster pattern characterization and end-to-end prediction of tumor properties. These methods have been applied in many studies aiming at lung cancer diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, shedding light on future non-invasive evaluations of the nodule malignancy, histological subtypes, genomic properties and treatment responses. In this review, we summarized and categorized the studies on the general workflow, methods for clinical prediction and clinical applications of machine learning in lung cancer radiomic studies, introduced some commonly-used software tools, and discussed the limitations of current methods and possible future directions.","Jiaqi Li, Zhuofeng Li, ...

In this paper, we test a landmark-based spatial normalization strategy as a framework for the seamless integration of any macroscopic dataset in the context of the Human Brain Project (HBP). This strategy stems from an approach called DISCO embedding sulcal constraints in a registration framework used to initialize DARTEL, the widely used spatial normalization approach proposed in the SPM software. We show that this strategy is efficient with a heterogeneous dataset including challenging data as preterm newborns, infants, post mortem histological data and a synthetic atlas computed from averaging the ICBM database, as well as more commonly studied data acquired in vivo in adults. We then describe some perspectives for a research program aiming at improving folding pattern matching for atlas inference in the context of the future HBP’s portal.","J. Lebenberg, M. Labit, ...

Automated brain tumor segmentation on multi-modal MR image using SegNet,/article/10.1007/s41095-019-0139-y,"The potential of improving disease detection and treatment planning comes with accurate and fully automatic algorithms for brain tumor segmentation. Glioma, a type of brain tumor, can appear at different locations with different shapes and sizes. Manual segmentation of brain tumor regions is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, and its performance depends on pathologists’ experience. In this paper, we tackle this problem by applying a fully convolutional neural network SegNet to 3D data sets for four MRI modalities (Flair, T1, T1ce, and T2) for automated segmentation of brain tumor and subtumor parts, including necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor. To further improve tumor segmentation, the four separately trained SegNet models are integrated by post-processing to produce four maximum feature maps by fusing the machine-learned feature maps from the fully convolutional layers of each trained model. The maximum feature maps and the pixel intensity values of the original MRI modalities are combined to encode interesting information into a feature representation. Taking the combined feature as input, a decision tree (DT) is used to classify the MRI voxels into different tumor parts and healthy brain tissue. Evaluating the proposed algorithm on the dataset provided by the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2017 (BraTS 2017) challenge, we achieved F-measure scores of 0.85, 0.81, and 0.79 for whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor, respectively.","Salma Alqazzaz, Xianfang Sun, ...

The MWCNTs of controlled diameter distribution was selectively grown on NiO catalyst supported by Al2O3 nano particles. The argon and acetylene were used as carrier and carbon precursor gas, respectively. The catalyst and carbon samples were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis. From this investigation, it is understood that the increase in reaction temperature and flow rate of precursor gas increased the mean diameter of MWCNTs but increase in process time decreased the diameter. The diameter distribution and quality of MWCNTs are strongly influenced by the diameter of the catalyst particles.","Sivamaran Venkatesan, Balasubramanian Visvalingam, ... A. Gourav Rao",2018-11-01

Using pre-post scores, we identified students with both positive and negative gains and examined how each group’s CT practices developed as they engaged with the curricular unit. Our results show that (1) students exhibited science and computational learning gains after engaging with a science unit with computational models and (2) that the use of embedded assessments and discourse analytics tools reveals how students think differently with computational tools throughout the unit.","Golnaz Arastoopour Irgens, Sugat Dabholkar, ...

These criteria are used to critique the most widely discussed neuroscience theories of consciousness. Among them are some satisfying some of the key requirements, though none meets all. I propose that a neuroscientific understanding of consciousness requires us to start thinking of the brain not as a connectome, i.e., a neural network, but as a neural hypernetwork consisting of neuronal groups with specific cognitive properties.

Human Brain Atlases in Stroke Management,/article/10.1007/s12021-020-09462-y,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and a major cause of permanent disability. Its management is demanding because of variety of protocols, imaging modalities, pulse sequences, hemodynamic maps, criteria for treatment, and time constraints to promptly evaluate and treat. To cope with some of these issues, we propose novel, patented solutions in stroke management by employing multiple brain atlases for diagnosis, treatment, and prediction. Numerous and diverse CT and MRI scans are used: ARIC cohort, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke CT cases, MRI cases with multiple pulse sequences, and 128 stroke CT patients, each with 170 variables and one year follow-up. The method employs brain atlases of anatomy, blood supply territories, and probabilistic stroke atlas. It rapidly maps an atlas to scan and provides atlas-assisted scan processing. Atlas-to-scan mapping is application-dependent and handles three types of regions of interest (ROIs): atlas-defined ROIs, atlas-quantified ROIs, and ROIs creating an atlas. An ROI is defined by atlas-guided anatomy or scan-derived pathology. The atlas defines ROI or quantifies it. A brain atlas potential has been illustrated in four atlas-assisted applications for stroke occurrence prediction and screening, rapid and automatic stroke diagnosis in emergency room, quantitative decision support in thrombolysis in ischemic stroke, and stroke outcome prediction and treatment assessment. The use of brain atlases in stroke has many potential advantages, including rapid processing, automated and robust handling, wide range of applications, and quantitative assessment.

"The brain’s default network: updated anatomy, physiology and evolving insights",/article/10.1038/s41583-019-0212-7,"Discoveries over the past two decades demonstrate that regions distributed throughout the association cortex, often called the default network, are suppressed during tasks that demand external attention and are active during remembering, envisioning the future and making social inferences. This Review describes progress in understanding the organization and function of networks embedded within these association regions. Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations. These association networks (and presumably thalamocortical circuits) are expanded in humans and might be particularly vulnerable to dysregulation implicated in mental illness.","Randy L.

Large-scale Exploration of Neuronal Morphologies Using Deep Learning and Augmented Reality,/article/10.1007/s12021-018-9361-5,"Recently released large-scale neuron morphological data has greatly facilitated the research in neuroinformatics. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for efficient and accurate neuron exploration. In this paper, we propose an effective retrieval framework to address these problems, based on frontier techniques of deep learning and binary coding. For the first time, we develop a deep learning based feature representation method for the neuron morphological data, where the 3D neurons are first projected into binary images and then learned features using an unsupervised deep neural network, i.e., stacked convolutional autoencoders (SCAEs). The deep features are subsequently fused with the hand-crafted features for more accurate representation. Considering the exhaustive search is usually very time-consuming in large-scale databases, we employ a novel binary coding method to compress feature vectors into short binary codes. Our framework is validated on a public data set including 58,000 neurons, showing promising retrieval precision and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Event-based Sensing for Space Situational Awareness,/article/10.1007/s40295-018-00140-5,"A revolutionary type of imaging device, known as a silicon retina or event-based sensor, has recently been developed and is gaining in popularity in the field of artificial vision systems. These devices are inspired by a biological retina and operate in a significantly different way to traditional CCD-based imaging sensors. While a CCD produces frames of pixel intensities, an event-based sensor produces a continuous stream of events, each of which is generated when a pixel detects a change in log light intensity. These pixels operate asynchronously and independently, producing an event-based output with high temporal resolution. There are also no fixed exposure times, allowing these devices to offer a very high dynamic range independently for each pixel. Additionally, these devices offer high-speed, low power operation and a sparse spatio-temporal output. As a consequence, the data from these sensors must be interpreted in a significantly different way to traditional imaging sensors and this paper explores the advantages this technology provides for space imaging. The applicability and capabilities of event-based sensors for SSA applications are demonstrated through telescope field trials. Trial results have confirmed that the devices are capable of observing resident space objects from LEO through to GEO orbital regimes. Significantly, observations of RSOs were made during both day-time and night-time (terminator) conditions without modification to the camera or optics. The event based sensor’s ability to image stars and satellites during day-time hours offers a dramatic capability increase for terrestrial optical sensors. This paper shows the field testing and validation of two different architectures of event-based imaging sensors. An event-based sensor’s asynchronous output has an intrinsically low data-rate. In addition to low-bandwidth communications requirements, the low weight, low-power and high-speed make them ideally suitable to meeting the demanding challenges required by space-based SSA systems. Results from these experiments and the systems developed highlight the applicability of event-based sensors to ground and space-based SSA tasks.","Gregory Cohen, Saeed Afshar, ...

Networks are trained with biologically motivated, unsupervised learning rules to obtain a self-organized grid of filters via cooperative and competitive excitatory-inhibitory interactions. Several inhibition strategies are developed and tested, such as (i) incrementally increasing inhibition level over the course of network training, and (ii) switching the inhibition level from low to high (two-level) after an initial training segment. During the labeling phase, the spiking activity generated by data with known labels is used to assign neurons to categories of data, which are then used to evaluate the network’s classification ability on a held-out set of test data. Several biologically plausible evaluation rules are proposed and compared, including a population-level confidence rating, and an n-gram inspired method.

A Bit-Encoding Based New Data Structure for Time and Memory Efficient Handling of Spike Times in an Electrophysiological Setup,/article/10.1007/s12021-018-9367-z,"Recent neuroscientific and technical developments of brain machine interfaces have put increasing demands on neuroinformatic databases and data handling software, especially when managing data in real time from large numbers of neurons. Extrapolating these developments we here set out to construct a scalable software architecture that would enable near-future massive parallel recording, organization and analysis of neurophysiological data on a standard computer. To this end we combined, for the first time in the present context, bit-encoding of spike data with a specific communication format for real time transfer and storage of neuronal data, synchronized by a common time base across all unit sources. We demonstrate that our architecture can simultaneously handle data from more than one million neurons and provide, in real time (< 25 ms), feedback based on analysis of previously recorded data. In addition to managing recordings from very large numbers of neurons in real time, it also has the capacity to handle the extensive periods of recording time necessary in certain scientific and clinical applications. Furthermore, the bit-encoding proposed has the additional advantage of allowing an extremely fast analysis of spatiotemporal spike patterns in a large number of neurons. Thus, we conclude that this architecture is well suited to support current and near-future Brain Machine Interface requirements.","Bengt Ljungquist, Per Petersson, ... Martin Garwicz",2018-03-05
The Problem of Free Will and Modern Neuroscience,/article/10.1007/s11055-019-00781-5,"This article discusses the various manifestations of free will. Making it an adequately defined subject for neuroscientific study requires basic phenomenological analysis. The inadequacy of denying free will on the basis of Libet’s and Soon’s experiments is demonstrated. The manifestations of free will are the phenomena of subjective reality. The question is how they are connected with cerebral processes. An information-based approach is proposed to answer this difficult question. Mental causality is regarded as informational causality and is linked with the concept of “top-down emergent causality” [Sperry, 1994], which provides an explanation of free will as an expression of the process of self-organization or self-determination at the level of the Ego system of the brain. The strategic importance of neuroscientific investigations of the problem of the “I” and the activity of consciousness as the ability to express will are emphasized.",D. I. Dubrovsky,2019-06-12

Towards Portable Large-Scale Image Processing with High-Performance Computing,/article/10.1007/s10278-018-0080-0,"High-throughput, large-scale medical image computing demands tight integration of high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure for data storage, job distribution, and image processing. The Vanderbilt University Institute for Imaging Science (VUIIS) Center for Computational Imaging (CCI) has constructed a large-scale image storage and processing infrastructure that is composed of (1) a large-scale image database using the eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT), (2) a content-aware job scheduling platform using the Distributed Automation for XNAT pipeline automation tool (DAX), and (3) a wide variety of encapsulated image processing pipelines called “spiders.” The VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure have housed and processed nearly half-million medical image volumes with Vanderbilt Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE), which is the HPC facility at the Vanderbilt University. The initial deployment was natively deployed (i.e., direct installations on a bare-metal server) within the ACCRE hardware and software environments, which lead to issues of portability and sustainability. First, it could be laborious to deploy the entire VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure to another HPC center with varying hardware infrastructure, library availability, and software permission policies. Second, the spiders were not developed in an isolated manner, which has led to software dependency issues during system upgrades or remote software installation. To address such issues, herein, we describe recent innovations using containerization techniques with XNAT/DAX which are used to isolate the VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure from the underlying hardware and software environments. The newly presented XNAT/DAX solution has the following new features: (1) multi-level portability from system level to the application level, (2) flexible and dynamic software development and expansion, and (3) scalable spider deployment compatible with HPC clusters and local workstations.","Yuankai Huo, Justin Blaber, ...

EECoG-Comp: An Open Source Platform for Concurrent EEG/ECoG Comparisons—Applications to Connectivity Studies,/article/10.1007/s10548-019-00708-w,"Electrophysiological Source Imaging (ESI) is hampered by lack of “gold standards” for model validation. Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) experiments (EECoG) are useful for this purpose, especially primate models due to their flexibility and translational value for human research. Unfortunately, there is only one EECoG experiments in the public domain that we know of: the Multidimensional Recording (MDR) is based on a single monkey (www.neurotycho.org). The mining of this type of data is hindered by lack of specialized procedures to deal with: (1) Severe EECoG artifacts due to the experimental produces; (2) Sophisticated forward models that account for surgery induced skull defects and implanted ECoG electrode strips; (3) Reliable statistical procedures to estimate and compare source connectivity (partial correlation). We provide solutions to the processing issues just mentioned with EECoG-Comp: an open source platform (https://github.com/Vincent-wq/EECoG-Comp). EECoG lead fields calculated with FEM (Simbio) for MDR data are also provided and were used in other papers of this special issue. As a use case with the MDR, we show: (1) For real MDR data, 4 popular ESI methods (MNE, LCMV, eLORETA and SSBL) showed significant but moderate concordance with a usual standard, the ECoG Laplacian (standard partial \( AUC = 0.65 \pm 0.05 \)); (2) In both monkey and human simulations, all ESI methods as well as Laplacian had a significant but poor correspondence with the true source connectivity. These preliminary results may stimulate the development of improved ESI connectivity estimators but require the availability of more EECoG data sets to obtain neurobiologically valid inferences.","Qing Wang, Pedro Antonio Valdés-Hernández, ...

Group sparse reduced rank regression for neuroimaging genetic study,/article/10.1007/s11280-018-0637-3,"The neuroimaging genetic study usually needs to deal with high dimensionality of both brain imaging data and genetic data, so that often resulting in the issue of curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a group sparse reduced rank regression model to take the relations of both the phenotypes and the genotypes for the neuroimaging genetic study. Specifically, we propose designing a graph sparsity constraint as well as a reduced rank constraint to simultaneously conduct subspace learning and feature selection. The group sparsity constraint conducts feature selection to identify genotypes highly related to neuroimaging data, while the reduced rank constraint considers the relations among neuroimaging data to conduct subspace learning in the feature selection model. Furthermore, an alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting objective function and is proved to achieve fast convergence. Experimental results on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset showed that the proposed method has superiority on predicting the phenotype data by the genotype data, than the alternative methods under comparison.","Xiaofeng Zhu, Heung-Il Suk, Dinggang Shen",2018-09-17

Neuronal devices: understanding neuronal cultures through percolation helps prepare for the next step,/article/10.1140/epjst/e2018-800072-1,"Cultures of dissociated neurons are an invaluable experimental tool in studying neuronal networks at an intermediate scale in an in vitro controlled physico-chemical environment. Moreover, current micro-fabrication techniques allow the design of a custom connectivity between subpopulations, which could make it possible to carry out computations with devices involving living cells. The quorum percolation (QP) model has been designed in the context of neurobiology to describe bursts of activity occurring in neuronal cultures from the point of view of collective phenomena rather than from a dynamical synchronization approach. Such a model is well suited to describe triggered activity in neuronal devices, and its generic character points at the necessity of heavily structured devices to go beyond collective bursting. We derive a continuous extension of the QP model, seen as information propagation on a non-metric directed graph, and discuss how its critical behavior might give insight on the connectivity of neuronal networks. The link with metric graphs, embedded in a two-dimensional space, is tackled by the introduction of a geometrical model based upon a random walk, where axon growth is constrained by obstacles such as walls and channels. This provides a starting point for the construction of neuronal devices in vitro capable of more complex behaviors. Lastly, we show how simulations of bursts with a dynamical adaptive integrate-and-fire model can be interpreted in terms of QP, confirming the robustness of this synchronized behavior.","Pascal Monceau, Stéphane Métens, ...

Similar changes in the metabolism of monoamines (MAs) and an increase in seizure susceptibility (SS), which were found at different states of cerebral hemodynamics at 1 hour and 24 hours after hemorrhage, had different causes. In the first case, the changes were mainly due to insufficient cerebral circulation and hypoxia occurring after blood loss, and in the second case, they were due to the prolongation of previous disorders, which continued after the recovery of cerebral hemodynamics. A deficiency of the MA and MA-synthesizing capacity of the brain after acute blood loss extended the duration of functional disorders in the central nervous system, even after the restoration of cerebral circulation.","M.

The oscillatory-network approach demonstrates the following capabilities: (1) high-quality segmentation of real grey-level and color images; (2) selective image segmentation (exclusion of unnecessary information); (3) solution of the simplest problem of object selection in a visual scene—the problem of the successive selection of all spatially separated image fragments of almost equal brightness.,"E.

Estimation of the Parameters for Tremograms According to the Eskov–Zinchenko Effect,/article/10.1134/S0006350918020082,"The features of the chaotic dynamics of parameters of the neuromuscular system (tremors) were studied using conventional and novel biological methods based on a multidimensional phase-space representation. The dynamics of involuntary micromovements of limbs (finger tremor) both in the relaxation phase (F = 0) and under static load (F = 3N) was manifested in a change in the number of “coincidences” of randomly selected sample pairs (k) of matrices (15 × 15) in paired comparison of tremograms, which demonstrated the global statistical instability of the samples (statistical distribution functions f(x), spectral densities of signals, and autocorrelation A(t)). The samples that result from one experiment cannot be randomly repeated in the next experiment (with the same homeostasis). This represents a quantitative measure of the Eskov–Zinchenko effect in the analysis of chaotically changing statistical distribution functions of tremogram samples. In this paper, the use of quasi-attractor parameters of tremograms (their areas) is proposed to represent changes in the neuromuscular system when passing from one homeostasis to another (G1 ≠ G2).","O.

In this model, all signals are broadcast: each neuron’s activity can be perceived by all other neurons that are sensitive to its neurotransmitter. The purpose of leaving synapses out is to demonstrate the importance of heterochemical1 interactions in the nervous system. Transmitter-specific neurons are described as finite automatons, which are a generalization of the traditional formal neuron. In a network consisting of such neurons, all connections are functional and not structural. This feature makes it possible to explain rapid reconfigurations of activity patterns in the generation of different rhythms by neuron ensembles, which are observed in living systems.

For images with rich texture, most of the existing image smoothing methods are difficult to obtain significant texture removal performance because texture containing obvious edges and large gradient changes is easy to be preserved as the main edges. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (DSHFG) for image smoothing combined with the constraint of sparse high frequency gradient for texture images. First, we decompose the image into two components: a smooth component (constant component) and a non-smooth (high frequency) component. Second, we remove the non-smooth component containing high frequency gradient and smooth the other component combining with the constraint of sparse high frequency gradient. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is more competitive on efficiently texture removing than the state-of-the-art methods. What is more, our approach has a variety of applications including edge detection, detail magnification, image abstraction, and image composition.","Guang-Hao Ma, Ming-Li Zhang, ...

In this study, we show that memristive behavior provides a broad working framework for the phenomenological modelling of cellular synaptic mechanisms. In particular, we seek to understand how close a memristive system can account for the biological realism. The basic characteristics of memristive systems, i.e. voltage and memory behavior, are used to derive a voltage-based plasticity rule. We show that this model is suitable to account for a variety of electrophysiology plasticity data. Furthermore, we incorporate the plasticity model into an all-to-all connecting network scheme. Motivated by the auto-associative CA3 network of the hippocampus, we show that the implemented network allows the discrimination and processing of mnemonic pattern information, i.e. the formation of functional bidirectional connections resulting in the formation of local receptive fields. Since the presented plasticity model can be applied to real memristive devices as well, the presented theoretical framework can support both, the design of appropriate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing and the development of complex neuromorphic networks, which account for the specific advantage of memristive devices.","Nick Diederich, Thorsten Bartsch, ...

However, the mechanisms by which they influence the development of brain damage have been insufficiently studied. The purpose of this study is to analyze the BBB permeability and expression of markers of its structural and functional integrity in animals with hypoxia (rats subjected to hypoxia at the age of P7) at the early (1 hour after the hypoxia) and delayed (P28) periods of their development. In sections of the rat brains, we immunohistochemically evaluated the expression of HIF-1 and Rac1; the Evans blue dye content was measured by the photometric method in the brain homogenates. In animals subjected to hypoxia, BBB permeability increased, CD31 expression was reduced, RAC1 expression increased, HIF-1-positive cells were retained in the hippocampus mainly at the early stage of development; CD31 and RAC1 expression was suppressed during the delayed period of development. The most-pronounced brain damage at the age of P7 corresponds to changes in the structural and functional integrity and permeability of the BBB; the recovery of a neurological deficit and the permeability of the BBB (at the age of P28) under damage to the brain corresponds to the period of reparative angiogenesis, as well as manifestations of HIF-1 effects in endothelial cells and astrocytes in the cortex and limbic system.","N.

Time-shuffled autocorrelation functions were calculated, these corresponding to the sum of the correlation functions between responses to all bursts presented with the exception of responses evoked by one of the bursts. This approach excludes the effects of the refractory properties of the neuron being studied, allowing the responses of a single neuron to be used to evaluate the nature of the spike activity in the local population of cells with presumptively identical properties but which are statistically independent of each other. Significant variation in the statistical characteristics of output spike activity in different cells in the semicircular toroid was found, such that signals could be characterized in terms of different time properties.

Auto-Identification of Neuronal Activity Patterns as a Physiological Mechanism of Awareness,/article/10.1007/s11055-017-0462-7,"How do humans become aware of things, for example, flashes of light, odors, or pain? There is still no convincing answer to this question, though it is key to understanding any kind of consciousness. This article postulates an autorecognition mechanism whereby patterns of input excitation generated by a stimulus in one or several areas of the cortex give rise to patterns of output excitation identical (coinciding in terms of its main features) to the pattern of input excitation. The output excitation pattern is transmitted via massively parallel positive feedback to the inputs of the same areas of the cortex. Identical excitation patterns generated by the stimulus and transmitted by back projections, are combined in the same neural structures, producing intense firing. This cyclic process accentuates the characteristics and intensifies stimulus mapping, creating the optimum conditions for its categorization by a distributed long-term memory. The sensory category is the response of the cortex to the input excitation and is mapped as a specific pattern of neuron activity. Categorization patterns are transmitted to the input and are included in the auto-identification cycle, providing for the intensive mapping of the subjective meaning of the stimulus. Mapping of sensory categories (internal data) as patterns of input neuron activity in the cortex forms the representation of categories to the subject as elements in the mapping of the external world.

An Asynchronous Discrete Model of Chemical Interactions in Simple Neuronal Systems,/article/10.3103/S0147688218060072,"An asynchronous discrete model of nonsynaptic chemical interactions between neurons is proposed. The model significantly extends the previous work [1, 2] by novel concepts that make it more biologically plausible. In the model, neurons interact by emitting neurotransmitters to the shared extracellular space (ECS). We introduce the dynamics of membrane potentials that comprises two factors: the endogenous rates of change depending on the neuron’s firing type and the exogenous rates of change depending on the concentrations of neurotransmitters that the neuron is sensitive to. The neuron’s firing type is determined by the individual composition of endogenous rates. We consider three basic firing types: oscillatory, tonic, and reactive. Each firing type is essential for modeling central pattern generators—neural ensembles that generate rhythmic activity in the absence of external stimuli. Differences in endogenous rates of different neurons lead to asynchronous neural interactions and significant variability of phase durations in the activity patterns present in simple neural systems. The algorithm computing the behavior of the proposed model is provided.","O. P. Kuznetsov, N. I. Bazenkov, ... I. A. Chistopolsky",2018-12-01
DICOM Standard Conformance in Veterinary Medicine in Germany: a Survey of Imaging Studies in Referral Cases,/article/10.1007/s10278-017-9998-x,"In 2016, the recommendations of the DICOM Standards Committee for the use of veterinary identification DICOM tags had its 10th anniversary. The goal of our study was to survey veterinary DICOM standard conformance in Germany regarding the specific identification tags veterinarians should use in veterinary diagnostic imaging. We hypothesized that most veterinarians in Germany do not follow the guidelines of the DICOM Standards Committee. We analyzed the metadata of 488 imaging studies of referral cases from 115 different veterinary institutions in Germany by computer-aided DICOM header readout. We found that 25 (5.1%) of the imaging studies fully complied with the “veterinary DICOM standard” in this survey. The results confirmed our hypothesis that the recommendations of the DICOM Standards Committee for the consistent and advantageous use of veterinary identification tags have found minimal acceptance amongst German veterinarians. DICOM does not only enable connectivity between machines, DICOM also improves communication between veterinarians by sharing correct and valuable metadata for better patient care. Therefore, we recommend that lecturers, universities, societies, authorities, vendors, and other stakeholders should increase their effort to improve the spread of the veterinary DICOM standard in the veterinary world.","Andreas Brühschwein, Julius Klever, ...

Chaotic Dynamics of Neuromuscular System Parameters and the Problems of the Evolution of Complexity,/article/10.1134/S0006350917060057,"The evolution rate v(t) varies among diverse biosystems, but a general theory can be formulated when the dynamics of the biosystem stater x = x(t) = (x1, x2, x

A mathematical approach is proposed for evaluating such processes and describes the processes in terms of particular chaos of the statistical distribution functions f(x). In the case of complex multicomponent systems with a high dimension number m (m ≫1) of the phase space of states, we propose using pairwise comparison matrices of samples x(t) when homeostasis is constant and calculating the parameters of quasiattractors. The Glensdorff–Prigogine thermodynamic approach to estimating evolution is inefficient in assessing the third-type systems, while it is applicable and the Prigogine theorem works at the level of molecular systems. Alterations in the state of the human neuromuscular system were found to lead to chaotic changes in the statistical functions f(x) in tremor recording samples, while quasiattractor parameters demonstrate a certain regularity.","V.

Personality development in psychotherapy: a synergetic model of state-trait dynamics,/article/10.1007/s11571-018-9488-y,"Theoretical models of psychotherapy not only try to predict outcome but also intend to explain patterns of change. Studies showed that psychotherapeutic change processes are characterized by nonlinearity, complexity, and discontinuous transitions. By this, theoretical models of psychotherapy should be able to reproduce these dynamic features. Using time series derived from daily measures through internet-based real-time monitoring as empirical reference, we earlier presented a model of psychotherapy which includes five state variables and four trait variables. In mathematical terms, the traits modulate the shape of the functions which define the nonlinear interactions between the variables (states) of the model. The functions are integrated into five coupled nonlinear difference equations. In the present paper, we model how traits (dispositions or competencies of a person) can continuously be altered by new experiences and states (cognition, emotion, behavior). Adding equations that link states to traits, this model not only describes how therapeutic interventions modulate short-term change and fluctuations of psychological states, but also how these can influence traits. Speaking in terms of Synergetics (theory of self-organization in complex systems), the states correspond to the order parameters and the traits to the control parameters of the system. In terms of psychology, trait dynamics is driven by the states—i.e., by the concrete experiences of a client—and creates a process of personality development at a slower time scale than that of the state dynamics (separation of time scales between control and order parameter dynamics).","Helmut Schöller, Kathrin Viol, ...

An ontology-based search engine for digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology,/article/10.1007/s40708-017-0062-x,"Neuronal morphology is extremely diverse across and within animal species, developmental stages, brain regions, and cell types. This diversity is functionally important because neuronal structure strongly affects synaptic integration, spiking dynamics, and network connectivity. Digital reconstructions of axonal and dendritic arbors are thus essential to quantify and model information processing in the nervous system. NeuroMorpho.Org is an established repository containing tens of thousands of digitally reconstructed neurons shared by several hundred laboratories worldwide. Each neuron is annotated with specific metadata based on the published references and additional details provided by data owners. The number of represented metadata concepts has grown over the years in parallel with the increase of available data. Until now, however, the lack of standardized terminologies and of an adequately structured metadata schema limited the effectiveness of user searches. Here we present a new organization of NeuroMorpho.Org metadata grounded on a set of interconnected hierarchies focusing on the main dimensions of animal species, anatomical regions, and cell types. We have comprehensively mapped each metadata term in NeuroMorpho.Org to this formal ontology, explicitly resolving all ambiguities caused by synonymy and homonymy. Leveraging this consistent framework, we introduce OntoSearch, a powerful functionality that seamlessly enables retrieval of morphological data based on expert knowledge and logical inferences through an intuitive string-based user interface with auto-complete capability. In addition to returning the data directly matching the search criteria, OntoSearch also identifies a pool of possible hits by taking into consideration incomplete metadata annotation.","Sridevi Polavaram, Giorgio A.

Efficient sparse matrix-delayed vector multiplication for discretized neural field model,/article/10.1007/s11227-017-2194-4,"Computational models of the human brain provide an important tool for studying the principles behind brain function and disease. To achieve whole-brain simulation, models are formulated at the level of neuronal populations as systems of delayed differential equations. In this paper, we show that the integration of large systems of sparsely connected neural masses is similar to well-studied sparse matrix-vector multiplication; however, due to delayed contributions, it differs in the data access pattern to the vectors. To improve data locality, we propose a combination of node reordering and tiled schedules derived from the connectivity matrix of the particular system, which allows performing multiple integration steps within a tile. We present two schedules: with a serial processing of the tiles and one allowing for parallel processing of the tiles. We evaluate the presented schedules showing speedup up to \(2\,\times \) on single-socket CPU, and \(1.25\,\times \) on Xeon Phi accelerator.",Jan Fousek,2017-12-15
On the Data-Driven Road from Neurology to Neuronomy,/article/10.1007/s12021-016-9305-x,"At the inaugural editorial board meeting of this journal some 15 years ago, one of the topics of discussion was how to measure overall success for the nascent field of neuroinformatics. The critical context for this question was the sprawling growth of the “NeuroX” vocabulary: not just neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neurocomputing, and neuroimaging, but also neuroethics, neuroevolution, neuroeconomics, neuropolicy, and neuroaesthetics. Among the most controversial ideas that were floated, it was predicted that, if fully successful, neuroinformatics would disappear as a subfield of neuroscience because all of neuroscience would become neuroinformatics. The rationale for such a seemingly preposterous proposals was rooted in one of the defining goals of neuroinformatics, namely to provide an information infrastructure for neuroscience.Footnote 1 Thus, the argument went, when neuroscience becomes a sufficiently mature discipline to fully integrate experimental design and analysis, theory, and computational simulations, neuroinformatics will simply be the underlying framework for data flow among all approaches.",Giorgio A.

Mitigating head motion artifact in functional connectivity MRI,/article/10.1038/s41596-018-0065-y,"Participant motion during functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) acquisition produces spurious signal fluctuations that can confound measures of functional connectivity. Without mitigation, motion artifact can bias statistical inferences about relationships between connectivity and individual differences. To counteract motion artifact, this protocol describes the implementation of a validated, high-performance denoising strategy that combines a set of model features, including physiological signals, motion estimates, and mathematical expansions, to target both widespread and focal effects of subject movement. This protocol can be used to reduce motion-related variance to near zero in studies of functional connectivity, providing up to a 100-fold improvement over minimal-processing approaches in large datasets. Image denoising requires 40 min to 4 h of computing per image, depending on model specifications and data dimensionality. The protocol additionally includes instructions for assessing the performance of a denoising strategy. Associated software implements all denoising and diagnostic procedures, using a combination of established image-processing libraries and the eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline (XCP) software.","Rastko Ciric, Adon F.

Implementing diffusion-weighted MRI for body imaging in prospective multicentre trials: current considerations and future perspectives,/article/10.1007/s00330-017-4972-z,"For body imaging, diffusion-weighted MRI may be used for tumour detection, staging, prognostic information, assessing response and follow-up. Disease detection and staging involve qualitative, subjective assessment of images, whereas for prognosis, progression or response, quantitative evaluation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is required. Validation and qualification of ADC in multicentre trials involves examination of i) technical performance to determine biomarker bias and reproducibility and ii) biological performance to interrogate a specific aspect of biology or to forecast outcome. Unfortunately, the variety of acquisition and analysis methodologies employed at different centres make ADC values non-comparable between them. This invalidates implementation in multicentre trials and limits utility of ADC as a biomarker. This article reviews the factors contributing to ADC variability in terms of data acquisition and analysis. Hardware and software considerations are discussed when implementing standardised protocols across multi-vendor platforms together with methods for quality assurance and quality control. Processes of data collection, archiving, curation, analysis, central reading and handling incidental findings are considered in the conduct of multicentre trials. Data protection and good clinical practice are essential prerequisites. Developing international consensus of procedures is critical to successful validation if ADC is to become a useful biomarker in oncology.","N. M. deSouza, J. M. Winfield, ... Y. Liu",2017-09-27
Pleiotropic effects of schizophrenia-associated genetic variants in neuron firing and cardiac pacemaking revealed by computational modeling,/article/10.1038/s41398-017-0007-4,"Schizophrenia patients have an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. A possible factor underlying this comorbidity are the common variants in the large set of genes that have recently been discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) as risk genes of schizophrenia. Many of these genes control the cell electrogenesis and calcium homeostasis. We applied biophysically detailed models of layer V pyramidal cells and sinoatrial node cells to study the contribution of schizophrenia-associated genes on cellular excitability. By including data from functional genomics literature to simulate the effects of common variants of these genes, we showed that variants of voltage-gated Na+ channel or hyperpolarization-activated cation channel-encoding genes cause qualitatively similar effects on layer V pyramidal cell and sinoatrial node cell excitability. By contrast, variants of Ca2+ channel or transporter-encoding genes mostly have opposite effects on cellular excitability in the two cell types. We also show that the variants may crucially affect the propagation of the cardiac action potential in the sinus node. These results may help explain some of the cardiac comorbidity in schizophrenia, and may facilitate generation of effective antipsychotic medications without cardiac side-effects such as arrhythmia.","Tuomo Mäki-Marttunen, Glenn T.

Based on the in vitro two-dimensional development of neural networks in culture vessels by Ito, we match the synapse number saturation time to obtain suitable parameters for the development process, then determine the distribution of distances between connected neurons under such conditions. Our simulations obtain a clear exponential distribution instead of a power-law one, which indicates that Karbowski’s conclusion is invalid, at least for the case of in vitro neural network development in two-dimensional culture vessels.","Zhi-Song Lv, Chen-Ping Zhu, ...

Unpacking the Heterogeneity of Cognitive Functioning in Children and Adolescents with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder: Determining the Role of Moderators and Strengths,/article/10.1007/s41252-017-0034-4,"Children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) experience significant impairments in cognitive functioning, though substantial within-group heterogeneity is often observed. The purpose of this study was to characterize the cognitive profile of children and adolescents with FASD with a special focus on examining moderators of functioning and cognitive strengths. Children and adolescents with FASD (n = 87) and controls (n = 110), ages 5 to 18 years completed a cognitive test battery. MANOVA was used to evaluate between-group cognitive differences, as well as the role of age and gender as potential moderators. Relative strengths were evaluated using both within-subject and between-group methods. Participants with FASD were found to show significant impairment on all cognitive tasks relative to controls, with substantial deficits evident on a measure of mathematical skill. Though neither age nor gender emerged as moderators, significant three-way interactions between age, gender, and group were evident on measures of executive functioning (inhibition), verbal memory, and word identification. Tasks measuring higher-order complex attention and visuospatial processing emerged as possible relative strengths in the FASD group. Children and adolescents with FASD had significant cognitive impairment across multiple domains confirming high need for interventions. Differences in the cognitive functioning for boys and girls with FASD at different developmental periods, along with relative strengths, may serve to inform interventions and future longitudinal research.","Kaitlyn McLachlan, Angelina Paolozza, ...

Different adaptive methods are used (namely, artificial neural networks, group method of data handling, and projection to latent structures). The comparison of quality indicators of predictions with a horizon of 1–12 h between each other and with the trivial model prediction has shown that the best result is obtained for the average value of the responses of three neural networks that have been trained with different sets of initial weights. The prediction result of the group method of data handling is close to the result of neural networks, and the projection to latent structures is much worse. It is shown that an increase in the prediction horizon from 1 to 12 h reduces its quality but not dramatically, which makes it possible to use these methods for medium-term prediction.","I. N.

We found age-dependent enhancement of peak-wave discharges. At 2 months, the discharges were rare and weak, whereas 6-month-old rats had robust peak-wave discharges. We measured the concentrations of monoamines and their metabolites in 2- and 6-month-old WAG/Rij and Wistar rats in five brain structures: the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, striatum, and hippocampus. In 2-month-old WAG/Rij rats, we found a decrease in the concentration of dopamine (DA) metabolites (HVA) in the prefrontal cortex and striatum compared to Wistar rats. In 6-month-old WAG/Rij rats, we found a considerable decrease in the activity of DA system compared to Wistar rats in all five studied brain structures. Concentrations of both DA and its metabolites decreased. We found impairments of learning and memory of WAG/Rij rats compared to Wistar rats. Impairment of learning and memory were more pronounced in 6-month-old WAG/Rij rats compared to 2-month-old WAG/Rij rats. We believe that the DA system not only responds to emotionally positive states but is also a reward and reinforcement system. An increase in the concentration of DA and its metabolites by madopar prevents disturbances of learning and memory. Our general conclusion is that enhancement of absence epilepsy induces a strong deficit of activity of the mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal DA system, which induces depression-like behavior and disturbance of learning and memory in WAG/Rij rats. These are the mechanisms of the development of impairments and the integration of these impairments, as well as the aggravation and widening of pathological states.","E. A. Fedosova, A. A.

Evaluation of Postspike Changes in Neuronal Excitability by Comparing Ordinary and Shuffled Autocorrelation Functions,/article/10.1134/S0006350917060021,"Responses of single neurons to tonal signals amplitude-modulated by repeating segments of lowfrequency noise were studied in the dorsal (cochlear) medullary nucleus and midbrain auditory center (torus semicircularis) of the grass frog Rana temporaria. An autocorrelation function of the response to a total presentation and a shuffled autocorrelation function were derived. The latter was obtained by correlating the impulse response to each segment of the modulated signal with responses to all other segments with the exception of the initial one. After the necessary normalization, the function differed from the initial autocorrelation only in lacking postspike changes in excitability. A delay dependence of the ratio of the two functions directly demonstrated the time course of the postspike change in excitability of the studied cell. The majority of second-order neurons, which are in the dorsal nucleus of the medulla oblongata, were characterized only by brief intervals of absolute and relative refractoriness. However, cells with excitability that was markedly facilitated immediately after the refractory period were observed even in this nucleus. Neurons with a complex pattern of postspike changes in excitability were detected in the torus semicircularis. In these cells, a comparatively long postspike decrease in excitability was usually interrupted by intervals in which the neuron sensitivity was significantly higher than normal. The results demonstrate that spike generation has a marked effect on subsequent activity in brainstem auditory units. The effects may play an important role in the formation of the temporal pattern of neuronal responses to auditory signals.","N. G. Bibikov, S. V. Nizamov",2017-11-01

Mining Frequent Synchronous Patterns based on Item Cover Similarity,/article/10.2991/ijcis.11.1.39,"In previous work we presented CoCoNAD (Continuous-time Closed Neuron Assembly Detection), a method to find significant synchronous patterns in parallel point processes with the goal to analyze parallel neural spike trains in neurobiology3,9. A drawback of CoCoNAD and its accompanying methodology of pattern spectrum filtering (PSF) and pattern set reduction (PSR) is that it judges the (statistical) significance of a pattern only by the number of synchronous occurrences (support). However, the same number of occurrences can be significant for patterns consisting of items with a generally low occurrence rate, but explainable as a chance event for patterns consisting of items with a generally high occurrence rate, simply because more item occurrences produce more chance coincidences of items. In order to amend this drawback, we present in this paper an extension of the recently introduced CoCoNAD variant that is based on influence map overlap support (which takes both the number of synchronous events and the precision of synchrony into account), namely by transferring the idea of Jaccard item set mining to this setting: by basing pattern spectrum filtering upon item cover similarity measures, the number of coincidences is related to the item occurrence frequencies, which leads to an improved sensitivity for detecting synchronous events (or parallel episodes) in sequence data. We demonstrate the improved performance of our method by extensive experiments on artificial data sets.","Salatiel Ezennaya-Gomez, Christian Borgelt",2018-01-22

Automating NEURON Simulation Deployment in Cloud Resources,/article/10.1007/s12021-016-9315-8,"Simulations in neuroscience are performed on local servers or High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. Recently, cloud computing has emerged as a potential computational platform for neuroscience simulation. In this paper we compare and contrast HPC and cloud resources for scientific computation, then report how we deployed NEURON, a widely used simulator of neuronal activity, in three clouds: Chameleon Cloud, a hybrid private academic cloud for cloud technology research based on the OpenStack software; Rackspace, a public commercial cloud, also based on OpenStack; and Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing, based on Amazon’s proprietary software. We describe the manual procedures and how to automate cloud operations. We describe extending our simulation automation software called NeuroManager (Stockton and Santamaria, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 2015), so that the user is capable of recruiting private cloud, public cloud, HPC, and local servers simultaneously with a simple common interface. We conclude by performing several studies in which we examine speedup, efficiency, total session time, and cost for sets of simulations of a published NEURON model.","David B.

Use of artificial neural networks for classification of noisy seismic signals,/article/10.3103/S0747923917010054,"Automatic identification of noisy seismic events is still a problem. The process involves the analysis of complex relationships between data from different sources. Moreover, there are disturbing factors such as poor signal-to-noise ratio, the presence of accidental bursts of man-made noise, and changes in the amplitude and phase of the waves as they travel through the medium. The amount of observed data increases rapidly, so it is imperative to develop suitable and effective methods for processing and analyzing the influx of big data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) show promise as a disruptive technology that will accelerate and improve analysis of seismic signals. ANNs are easy to apply, and the results often outperform alternative methods. This paper gives an overview of the highs and lows of neural networks, discusses the possibility of routine processing of seismic signals using ANNs, and presents examples of some interesting applications. It is hoped that researchers who read the article will actively use this technique, because ANNs could become more robust and flexible for solving complex problems that currently cannot be solved by the standard approach.","K.

Adopting the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we reduce the dynamics to closed stochastic equations for the order parameters, and study these equations for the cases of populations of identical and nonidentical oscillators. For nonidentical oscillators we demonstrate a counterintuitive effect of divergence of individual frequencies for moderate repulsive coupling, while the order parameter remains large.","Denis S.

Wavelet correlations of nonstationary signals,/article/10.1134/S1063784217060068,"Two approaches to the analysis of nonstationary random signals are proposed and studied. The first approach is based on the adaptive Morlet wavelet that allows variations in time and frequency resolution of signals using an auxiliary control parameter. The second approach is related to the application of double correlation function that represents correlation of continuous wavelet transforms of two signals calculated in time and frequency domains. The advantages of the proposed correlation function in comparison with alternative correlation functions, in particular, analysis of both time and frequency correlations of nonstationary signals are outlined. Applications of the proposed approaches in the analysis of various transient processes in physics are discussed.","S. V. Bozhokin, S. V. Zharko, ... I. M. Sokolov",2017-06-24
N3DFix: an Algorithm for Automatic Removal of Swelling Artifacts in Neuronal Reconstructions,/article/10.1007/s12021-016-9308-7,"It is well established that not only electrophysiology but also morphology plays an important role in shaping the functional properties of neurons. In order to properly quantify morphological features it is first necessary to translate observational histological data into 3-dimensional geometric reconstructions of the neuronal structures. This reconstruction process, independently of being manual or (semi-)automatic, requires several preparation steps (e.g. histological processing) before data acquisition using specialized software. Unfortunately these processing steps likely produce artifacts which are then carried to the reconstruction, such as tissue shrinkage and formation of swellings. If not accounted for and corrected, these artifacts can change significantly the results from morphometric analysis and computer simulations. Here we present N3DFix, an open-source software which uses a correction algorithm to automatically find and fix swelling artifacts in neuronal reconstructions. N3DFix works as a post-processing tool and therefore can be used in either manual or (semi-)automatic reconstructions. The algorithm’s internal parameters have been defined using a “ground truth” dataset produced by a neuroanatomist, involving two complementary manual reconstruction procedures: in the first, neuronal topology was faithfully reconstructed, including all swelling artifacts; in the second procedure a meticulous correction of the artifacts was manually performed directly during neuronal tracing. The internal parameters of N3DFix were set to minimize the differences between manual amendments and the algorithm’s corrections. It is shown that the performance of N3DFix is comparable to careful manual correction of the swelling artifacts. To promote easy access and wide adoption, N3DFix is available in NEURON, Vaa3D and Py3DN.","Eduardo Conde-Sousa, Peter Szücs, ... Paulo Aguiar",2016-07-13
Predicting the spatiotemporal diversity of seizure propagation and termination in human focal epilepsy,/article/10.1038/s41467-018-02973-y,"Recent studies have shown that seizures can spread and terminate across brain areas via a rich diversity of spatiotemporal patterns. In particular, while the location of the seizure onset area is usually invariant across seizures in an individual patient, the source of traveling (2–3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges during seizures can either move with the slower propagating ictal wavefront or remain stationary at the seizure onset area. Furthermore, although many focal seizures terminate synchronously across brain areas, some evolve into distinct ictal clusters and terminate asynchronously. Here, we introduce a unifying perspective based on a new neural field model of epileptic seizure dynamics. Two main mechanisms, the co-existence of wave propagation in excitable media and coupled-oscillator dynamics, together with the interaction of multiple time scales, account for the reported diversity. We confirm our predictions in seizures and tractography data obtained from patients with pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. Our results contribute toward patient-specific seizure modeling.","Timothée Proix, Viktor K. Jirsa, ... Wilson Truccolo",2018-03-14
Linking connectomics and dynamics in the human brain,/article/10.1007/s13295-016-0027-1,"To understand human cognition, it is essential to study the brain on multiple levels, from microscopic to macroscopic scales. Computational connectomics is a new area of neuroscience where scientists seek to combine empirical observations within a computational theory of the brain. The whole-brain network modeling and simulation platform, The Virtual Brain (TVB), is a remarkable innovation in the field of computational connectomics. By combining the connectivity of individual persons with local biologically realistic population models, TVB allows simulation and prediction of the local activity of neuronal populations and the global activity unfolding along the gray matter, both of which can be linked to empirical measures of electrical, hemodynamic, and structural aspects of the brain. TVB is currently used to study the structural, functional, and computational alterations in the diseased brain with reported successes in stroke and epilepsy. Subject-specific brain models provided by TVB will result in robust and efficient personalized diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment.","Leon Stefanovski, Amna Ghani, ... Petra Ritter",2016-09-13

"The Evolution of the idea of homeostasis: Determinism, stochastics, and chaos–self-organization",/article/10.1134/S0006350917050074,"Homeostasis is a basic concept in investigating all living systems. Homeostasis and life are synonyms to a certain extent. The concept of homeostasis has been studied and developed for more than 150 years; however, only the 21st century brought us close to understanding homeostasis as a state of a biosystem and a continuous process. The chaos and self-organization theory (CSOT) proves that the conventional views based on determinism (functional analysis) or stochastics (when stochastic uncertainty or certainty occurs) cannot describe homeostasis as defined by W.B. Cannon and his followers. The new CSOT shows a clear boundary between determinism, stochastics (and deterministic chaos), and third-type systems, which have five special properties (principles of self-organization) and can be described in terms of quasiattractors. Kinematics is understood as the motion of quasi-attractors in the phase spaces of states. Complexity is introduced as the rate of evolution of complex biological systems, differing from the definition by Prigogine–Glansdorff. At the same time, concepts of uncertainty of the first and second types and an analog of the Heisenberg calculus are introduced for complexity. According to these concepts, complex biosystems are transferred from the area of traditional science to a new area of the theory of chaos and self-organization.","V. M. Eskov, O. E. Filatova, ... T.

Partners of humans: a realistic assessment of the role of robots in the foreseeable future,/article/10.1057/s41265-016-0032-4,"As robots are generally thought to perform human-like tasks, they depend on the successes of information technology in the area of artificial intelligence to succeed in such pursuits. But robots, through their anthropomorphic character and their weighty presence in science fiction, attract the attention of the press and the media in a way that, at times, blurs the distinction between the actual state of the art and exaggerated claims. This makes it hard to assess the true functional positioning of robots, how this is likely to move forward and whether the outcome of progress could be detrimental to human society. The aim of this paper is to review the actual level of competence that is being achieved in robotics research laboratories and a plausible impact that this is likely to have on human control over life and jobs. The key thesis here is that cognition in machines and even an artificial form of consciousness lead to operations in a set of tasks (the ‘algorithmic’ category) which is different from that available to truly cognitive and conscious human beings (the ‘life-need’ category): that is, in the paper it is argued that a major category error (Ryle in The concept of mind, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1949) looms in predictions of serious threats to humanity. As far as a threat to jobs goes, it is argued that early attention to education and re-skilling of humans in the workplace can lead to an effective symbiosis between people and robots.",Igor Aleksander,2017-03-15
Integrative synchronization mechanisms in connectionist cognitive neuroarchitectures,/article/10.1186/s40469-016-0010-8,"Based on the mathematics of nonlinear Dynamical System Theory, neurocognition can be analyzed by convergent fluid and transient neurodynamics in abstract n-dimensional system phase spaces in the form of nonlinear vector fields, vector streams or vector flows (the so-called “vectorial form”). This processual or dynamical perspective on cognition, including the dynamical binding mechanisms in cognitive neuroarchitectures, has the advantage of a more accurately modeling of the transient cognitive processes. Thus, neurocognition can be considered as being organized by integrative synchronization mechanisms which best explain the liquid flow of neurocognitive information orchestrated in a network of positive and/or negative feedback loops in the subcortical and cortical areas. The human neurocognitive system can be regarded as a nonlinear, dynamical and open nonequilibrium system. This new fluid or liquid perspective in cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience can be regarded as a contribution towards bridging the gap between the discrete, abstract symbolic description of propositions in the mind, and their continuous, numerical implementation in self-organizing neural networks modelling the neural information processing in the human brain.",Harald Maurer,2016-08-11

Many groups contributed their own algorithms for the project, including our mean shift and minimum spanning tree (M-MST). Although M-MST is intuitive and easy to implement, the MST just considers spatial information of single neuron and ignores the shape information, which might lead to less precise connections between some neuron segments. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm, namely M-AMST, in which a rotating sphere model based on coordinate transformation is used to improve the weight calculation method in M-MST.","Zhijiang Wan, Yishan He, ...

Name-calling in the hippocampus (and beyond): coming to terms with neuron types and properties,/article/10.1007/s40708-016-0053-3,"Widely spread naming inconsistencies in neuroscience pose a vexing obstacle to effective communication within and across areas of expertise. This problem is particularly acute when identifying neuron types and their properties. Hippocampome.org is a web-accessible neuroinformatics resource that organizes existing data about essential properties of all known neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation. Hippocampome.org links evidence supporting the assignment of a property to a type with direct pointers to quotes and figures. Mining this knowledge from peer-reviewed reports reveals the troubling extent of terminological ambiguity and undefined terms. Examples span simple cases of using multiple synonyms and acronyms for the same molecular biomarkers (or other property) to more complex cases of neuronal naming. New publications often use different terms without mapping them to previous terms. As a result, neurons of the same type are assigned disparate names, while neurons of different types are bestowed the same name. Furthermore, non-unique properties are frequently used as names, and several neuron types are not named at all. In order to alleviate this nomenclature confusion regarding hippocampal neuron types and properties, we introduce a new functionality of Hippocampome.org: a fully searchable, curated catalog of human and machine-readable definitions, each linked to the corresponding neuron and property terms. Furthermore, we extend our robust approach to providing each neuron type with an informative name and unique identifier by mapping all encountered synonyms and homonyms.","D. J. Hamilton, D. W.

Stationary ensembles in threshold networks,/article/10.1134/S0005117917030080,The networks of threshold elements are considered. The notion of a stationary ensemble is introduced. We set out necessary and sufficient conditions for a network to be an ensemble. We show that for two ensembles with common elements switching on one ensemble does not necessarily lead to switching on the other. A representation of an ensemble as a finite state machine is proposed. We then show how this representation can help study the processes of switching ensembles on and off. We note that a network of ensembles may be interpreted in neurobiological terms as a basis for a long-term memory model.

Large-scale brain dynamics: effect of connectivity resolution,/article/10.1186/1471-2202-16-S1-O20,"Large-scale brain dynamics recently started to be modeled numerically based on both heterogeneous large-scale networks build from diffusion MRI, that is, a connectome, and local homogeneous connectivity kernel representing intracortical synaptic connections. However, topological properties of a connectome can significantly change with resolution and parcellation [1]. Furthermore, the sampling of the cerebral surfaces, resulting in a geometric model, and, in this way, the local connectivity kernel play crucial roles in the formation of spatial patterns on the cerebral surfaces as well as on the sensor level (e.g., EEG electrodes) by a forward calculation [2]. However, the effect of sampling and parcellation on modeling brain dynamics has not been studied so far. Here, we investigate qualitatively and quantitatively: (i) how different parcellation resolutions affect the dynamics of the network; and (ii) how the local connectivity affects the network dynamics.

Optimal choice of a reference electrode for EEG recording,/article/10.3103/S0096392516030068,"We have studied topographical differences in averaged EEG amplitudes in alpha domain recorded in 10–20 system during “eyes closed” test. These differences appeared due to the use of 13 reference schemes: top and bottom of the chin (P1, P2); nose (N); top and bottom of the back of the neck (Sh1, Sh2); upper back (C); united electrodes at the base of the neck anteriorly and posteriorly (2Sh); united, ipsilateral, and individual ear electrodes (A12, Sym, A1, A2); vertex (Cz); and averaged reference (AR). Six experiments for each of the ten subjects were carried out with grounded and ungrounded states of three distant basic references P2, C, and 2Sh. Pairwise comparisons of topographic consistency of 13 reference schemes were carried out on the proposed complex of three independent indicators with evaluative criterion, followed by centroid-based clustering of the reference schemes and its discriminant verification. As a result, we have established (1) that most coordinated topography is provided by the following reference electrodes—A12, P1, P2, Sym; (2) reference electrodes A1, Sh2, A2, Sh1, AR, Cz are characterized by individually varying topography, which may lead to contradictory conclusions obtained when they are used; (3) no significant reasons have been found for preferring a grounded (neutral) states of reference electrodes, that makes the search for or mathematical construct of an infinitely remote neutral reference electrode less important.",A.

Imitating the brain with neurocomputer a “new” way towards artificial general intelligence,/article/10.1007/s11633-017-1082-y,"To achieve the artificial general intelligence (AGI), imitate the intelligence? or imitate the brain? This is the question! Most artificial intelligence (AI) approaches set the understanding of the intelligence principle as their premise. This may be correct to implement specific intelligence such as computing, symbolic logic, or what the AlphaGo could do. However, this is not correct for AGI, because to understand the principle of the brain intelligence is one of the most difficult challenges for our human beings. It is not wise to set such a question as the premise of the AGI mission. To achieve AGI, a practical approach is to build the so-called neurocomputer, which could be trained to produce autonomous intelligence and AGI. A neurocomputer imitates the biological neural network with neuromorphic devices which emulate the bio-neurons, synapses and other essential neural components. The neurocomputer could perceive the environment via sensors and interact with other entities via a physical body. The philosophy under the “new” approach, so-called as imitationalism in this paper, is the engineering methodology which has been practiced for thousands of years, and for many cases, such as the invention of the first airplane, succeeded. This paper compares the neurocomputer with the conventional computer. The major progress about neurocomputer is also reviewed.",Tie-Jun Huang,2017-05-26

The new ontological framework makes explicit how models bring together structural, functional, and related empirical observations. We emphasize schematics of the model’s operation linked to summaries of empirical data (SEDs) used in both the design and testing of the model, with tests comparing SEDs to summaries of simulation results (SSRs) from the model. We stress the importance of protocols for models as well as experiments. We complement the structural ontology of nested brain structures with a functional ontology of Brain Operating Principles (BOPs) for observed neural function and an ontological framework for grounding models in empirical data. We present an implementation of this ontological framework in the Brain Operation Database (BODB), an environment in which modelers and experimentalists can work together by making use of their shared empirical data, models and expertise.","Michael A.

A spectrum of sharing: maximization of information content for brain imaging data,/article/10.1186/s13742-014-0042-5,"Efforts to expand sharing of neuroimaging data have been growing exponentially in recent years. There are several different types of data sharing which can be considered to fall along a spectrum, ranging from simpler and less informative to more complex and more informative. In this paper we consider this spectrum for three domains: data capture, data density, and data analysis. Here the focus is on the right end of the spectrum, that is, how to maximize the information content while addressing the challenges. A summary of associated challenges of and possible solutions is presented in this review and includes: 1) a discussion of tools to monitor quality of data as it is collected and encourage adoption of data mapping standards; 2) sharing of time-series data (not just summary maps or regions); and 3) the use of analytic approaches which maximize sharing potential as much as possible. Examples of existing solutions for each of these points, which we developed in our lab, are also discussed including the use of a comprehensive beginning-to-end neuroinformatics platform and the use of flexible analytic approaches, such as independent component analysis and multivariate classification approaches, such as deep learning.",Vince D Calhoun,2015-01-29
Analytical Inverse Kinematics Solver for Anthropomorphic 7-DOF Redundant Manipulators with Human-Like Configuration Constraints,/article/10.1007/s10846-016-0449-6,"It is a common belief that service robots shall move in a human-like manner to enable natural and convenient interaction with a human user or collaborator. In particular, this applies to anthropomorphic 7-DOF redundant robot manipulators that have a shoulder-elbow-wrist configuration. On the kinematic level, human-like movement then can be realized by means of selecting a redundancy resolution for the inverse kinematics (IK), which realizes human-like movement through respective nullspace preferences. In this paper, key positions are introduced and defined as Cartesian positions of the manipulator’s elbow and wrist joints. The key positions are used as constraints on the inverse kinematics in addition to orientation constraints at the end-effector, such that the inverse kinematics can be calculated through an efficient analytical scheme and realizes human-like configurations. To obtain suitable key positions, a correspondence method named wrist-elbow-in-line is derived to map key positions of human demonstrations to the real robot for obtaining a valid analytical inverse kinematics solution. A human demonstration tracking experiment is conducted to evaluate the end-effector accuracy and human-likeness of the generated motion for a 7-DOF Kuka-LWR arm. The results are compared to a similar correspondance method that emphasizes only the wrist postion and show that the subtle differences between the two different correspondence methods may lead to significant performance differences. Furthermore, the wrist-elbow-in-line method is validated as more stable in practical application and extended for obstacle avoidance.","Weihui Liu, Diansheng Chen, Jochen Steil",2016-12-27
"The brain imaging data structure, a format for organizing and describing outputs of neuroimaging experiments",/article/10.1038/sdata.2016.44,"The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.","Krzysztof J.

Heterogeneous Optimization Framework: Reproducible Preprocessing of Multi-Spectral Clinical MRI for Neuro-Oncology Imaging Research,/article/10.1007/s12021-016-9296-7,"Neuroimaging research often relies on clinically acquired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets that can originate from multiple institutions. Such datasets are characterized by high heterogeneity of modalities and variability of sequence parameters. This heterogeneity complicates the automation of image processing tasks such as spatial co-registration and physiological or functional image analysis. Given this heterogeneity, conventional processing workflows developed for research purposes are not optimal for clinical data. In this work, we describe an approach called Heterogeneous Optimization Framework (HOF) for developing image analysis pipelines that can handle the high degree of clinical data non-uniformity. HOF provides a set of guidelines for configuration, algorithm development, deployment, interpretation of results and quality control for such pipelines. At each step, we illustrate the HOF approach using the implementation of an automated pipeline for Multimodal Glioma Analysis (MGA) as an example. The MGA pipeline computes tissue diffusion characteristics of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisitions, hemodynamic characteristics using a perfusion model of susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI, and spatial cross-modal co-registration of available anatomical, physiological and derived patient images. Developing MGA within HOF enabled the processing of neuro-oncology MR imaging studies to be fully automated. MGA has been successfully used to analyze over 160 clinical tumor studies to date within several research projects. Introduction of the MGA pipeline improved image processing throughput and, most importantly, effectively produced co-registered datasets that were suitable for advanced analysis despite high heterogeneity in acquisition protocols.","Mikhail Milchenko, Abraham Z.

It contributes to the view that neuroinformatics must include the informatics of computational modeling of neural systems as well as the development and linkage of database resources for both models and empirical data. The papers introduce key results in empirical research, computational modeling, and neuroinformatics for two areas of neuroscience–neurolinguistics and the study of neural mechanisms underlying manual action and its recognition–and assess ways in which the study of language processing can benefit from models of action production. Because the two areas span the spectrum from animal studies to human studies, and from basic sensorimotor processes to cognition, they provide a setting for assessing the diverse challenges of creating computational models for neuroscience, for providing databases for the very different forms of empirical data now exploited by neuroscience, and for linkage of data and models in systems and cognitive neuroscience generally, not just within our two focal areas.",Michael A.

The drift diffusion model as the choice rule in reinforcement learning,/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1199-y,"Current reinforcement-learning models often assume simplified decision processes that do not fully reflect the dynamic complexities of choice processes. Conversely, sequential-sampling models of decision making account for both choice accuracy and response time, but assume that decisions are based on static decision values. To combine these two computational models of decision making and learning, we implemented reinforcement-learning models in which the drift diffusion model describes the choice process, thereby capturing both within- and across-trial dynamics. To exemplify the utility of this approach, we quantitatively fit data from a common reinforcement-learning paradigm using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation, and compared model variants to determine whether they could capture the effects of stimulant medication in adult patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The model with the best relative fit provided a good description of the learning process, choices, and response times. A parameter recovery experiment showed that the hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach enabled accurate estimation of the model parameters. The model approach described here, using simultaneous estimation of reinforcement-learning and drift diffusion model parameters, shows promise for revealing new insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of learning and decision making, as well as the alteration of such processes in clinical groups.","Mads Lund Pedersen, Michael J.

The Resource Identification Initiative: A Cultural Shift in Publishing,/article/10.1007/s12021-015-9284-3,"A central tenet in support of research reproducibility is the ability to uniquely identify research resources, i.e., reagents, tools, and materials that are used to perform experiments. However, current reporting practices for research resources are insufficient to identify the exact resources that are reported or to answer basic questions such as “How did other studies use resource X?” To address this issue, the Resource Identification Initiative was launched as a pilot project to improve the reporting standards for research resources in the methods sections of papers and thereby improve identifiability and scientific reproducibility. The pilot engaged over 25 biomedical journal editors from most major publishers, as well as scientists and funding officials. Authors were asked to include Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) in their manuscripts prior to publication for three resource types: antibodies, model organisms, and tools (i.e., software and databases). RRIDs are assigned by an authoritative database, for example a model organism database, for each type of resource. To make it easier for authors to obtain RRIDs, resources were aggregated from the appropriate databases and their RRIDs made available in a central web portal (http://scicrunch.org/resources). RRIDs meet three key criteria: they are machine readable, free to generate and access, and are consistent across publishers and journals. The pilot was launched in February of 2014 and over 300 papers have appeared that report RRIDs. The number of journals participating has expanded from the original 25 to more than 40 with RRIDs appearing in 62 different journals to date. Here, we present an overview of the pilot project and its outcomes to date. We show that authors are able to identify resources and are supportive of the goals of the project. Identifiability of the resources post-pilot showed a dramatic improvement for all three resource types, suggesting that the project has had a significant impact on identifiability of research resources.","Anita Bandrowski, Matthew Brush, ...

The nature of unsupervised learning in deep neural networks: A new understanding and novel approach,/article/10.3103/S1060992X16030073,"Over the last decade, the deep neural networks are a hot topic in machine learning. It is breakthrough technology in processing images, video, speech, text and audio. Deep neural network permits us to overcome some limitations of a shallow neural network due to its deep architecture. In this paper we investigate the nature of unsupervised learning in restricted Boltzmann machine. We have proved that maximization of the log-likelihood input data distribution of restricted Boltzmann machine is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy and to special case of minimizing the mean squared error. Thus the nature of unsupervised learning is invariant to different training criteria. As a result we propose a new technique called “REBA” for the unsupervised training of deep neural networks. In contrast to Hinton’s conventional approach to the learning of restricted Boltzmann machine, which is based on linear nature of training rule, the proposed technique is founded on nonlinear training rule. We have shown that the classical equations for RBM learning are a special case of the proposed technique. As a result the proposed approach is more universal in contrast to the traditional energy-based model. We demonstrate the performance of the REBA technique using wellknown benchmark problem. The main contribution of this paper is a novel view and new understanding of an unsupervised learning in deep neural networks.","V. Golovko, A. Kroshchanka, D. Treadwell",2016-07-01

The global landscape of cognition: hierarchical aggregation as an organizational principle of human cortical networks and functions,/article/10.1038/srep18112,"Though widely hypothesized, limited evidence exists that human brain functions organize in global gradients of abstraction starting from sensory cortical inputs. Hierarchical representation is accepted in computational networks and tentatively in visual neuroscience, yet no direct holistic demonstrations exist in vivo. Our methods developed network models enriched with tiered directionality, by including input locations, a critical feature for localizing representation in networks generally. Grouped primary sensory cortices defined network inputs, displaying global connectivity to fused inputs. Depth-oriented networks guided analyses of fMRI databases (~17,000 experiments;~1/4 of fMRI literature). Formally, we tested whether network depth predicted localization of abstract versus concrete behaviors over the whole set of studied brain regions. For our results, new cortical graph metrics, termed network-depth, ranked all databased cognitive function activations by network-depth. Thus, we objectively sorted stratified landscapes of cognition, starting from grouped sensory inputs in parallel, progressing deeper into cortex. This exposed escalating amalgamation of function or abstraction with increasing network-depth, globally. Nearly 500 new participants confirmed our results. In conclusion, data-driven analyses defined a hierarchically ordered connectome, revealing a related continuum of cognitive function. Progressive functional abstraction over network depth may be a fundamental feature of brains and is observed in artificial networks.","P. Taylor, J. N. Hobbs, ... H. T. Siegelmann",2015-12-16

Interestingly, there are also attempts in pedagogic to not only individualise class teaching but to also put more emphasis on learner autonomy for a better learning effect and improved life-long learning abilities [1].

"A minimum-error, energy-constrained neural code is an instantaneous-rate code",/article/10.1007/s10827-016-0592-x,"Sensory neurons code information about stimuli in their sequence of action potentials (spikes). Intuitively, the spikes should represent stimuli with high fidelity. However, generating and propagating spikes is a metabolically expensive process. It is therefore likely that neural codes have been selected to balance energy expenditure against encoding error. Our recently proposed optimal, energy-constrained neural coder (Jones et al. Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, 9, 61 2015) postulates that neurons time spikes to minimize the trade-off between stimulus reconstruction error and expended energy by adjusting the spike threshold using a simple dynamic threshold. Here, we show that this proposed coding scheme is related to existing coding schemes, such as rate and temporal codes. We derive an instantaneous rate coder and show that the spike-rate depends on the signal and its derivative. In the limit of high spike rates the spike train maximizes fidelity given an energy constraint (average spike-rate), and the predicted interspike intervals are identical to those generated by our existing optimal coding neuron. The instantaneous rate coder is shown to closely match the spike-rates recorded from P-type primary afferents in weakly electric fish. In particular, the coder is a predictor of the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH). When tested against in vitro cortical pyramidal neuron recordings, the instantaneous spike-rate approximates DC step inputs, matching both the average spike-rate and the time-to-first-spike (a simple temporal code). Overall, the instantaneous rate coder relates optimal, energy-constrained encoding to the concepts of rate-coding and temporal-coding, suggesting a possible unifying principle of neural encoding of sensory signals.","Erik C.

As compared with a single neuron, such an aggregation is shown to reveal new properties: it has three stable states (inactive, semi-active, and active states) and demonstrates the hysteresis effect. These properties may enable the use of time inter-image correlations, competitive learning, image selection in recognition and higher noise robustness. These possibilities are regarded from the viewpoint of using the neural ensemble as a basic element of an adaptive neural net.","Yu. S. Prostov, Yu. V. Tiumentsev",2015-04-01

National Database for Autism Research (NDAR): Big Data Opportunities for Health Services Research and Health Technology Assessment,/article/10.1007/s40273-015-0331-6,"The National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) is a US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded research data repository created by integrating heterogeneous datasets through data sharing agreements between autism researchers and the NIH. To date, NDAR is considered the largest neuroscience and genomic data repository for autism research. In addition to biomedical data, NDAR contains a large collection of clinical and behavioral assessments and health outcomes from novel interventions. Importantly, NDAR has a global unique patient identifier that can be linked to aggregated individual-level data for hypothesis generation and testing, and for replicating research findings. As such, NDAR promotes collaboration and maximizes public investment in the original data collection. As screening and diagnostic technologies as well as interventions for children with autism are expensive, health services research (HSR) and health technology assessment (HTA) are needed to generate more evidence to facilitate implementation when warranted. This article describes NDAR and explains its value to health services researchers and decision scientists interested in autism and other mental health conditions.

Increased spatial granularity of left brain activation and unique age/gender signatures: a 4D frequency domain approach to cerebral lateralization at rest,/article/10.1007/s11682-015-9463-8,"Cerebral lateralization is a well-studied topic. However, most of the research to date in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been carried out on hemodynamic fluctuations of voxels, networks, or regions of interest (ROIs). For example, cerebral differences can be revealed by comparing the temporal activation of an ROI in one hemisphere with the corresponding homotopic region in the other hemisphere. While this approach can reveal significant information about cerebral organization, it does not provide information about the full spatiotemporal organization of the hemispheres. The cerebral differences revealed in literature suggest that hemispheres have different spatiotemporal organization in the resting state. In this study, we evaluate cerebral lateralization in the 4D spatiotemporal frequency domain to compare the hemispheres in the context of general activation patterns at different spatial and temporal scales. We use a gender-balanced resting fMRI dataset comprising over 600 healthy subjects ranging in age from 12 to 71, that have previously been studied with a network specific voxel-wise and global analysis of lateralization (Agcaoglu, et al. NeuroImage, 2014). Our analysis elucidates significant differences in the spatiotemporal organization of brain activity between hemispheres, and generally more spatiotemporal fluctuation in the left hemisphere especially in the high spatial frequency bands, and more power in the right hemisphere in the low and middle spatial frequencies. Importantly, the identified effects are not visible in the context of a typical assessment of voxelwise, regional, or even global laterality, thus our study highlights the value of 4D spatiotemporal frequency domain analyses as a complementary and powerful tool for studying brain function.","O.

In the framework of TVB we build full brain network models by incorporating biologically realistic large scale couplings of neural populations. The couplings within the network are captured by the space-time structure of the connectivity matrix, which defines the connection strengths and time delays via signal transmission between all network nodes. Researchers from computational, theoretical and clinical neuroscience can benefit of this tool.

Adaptive control system for a mobile agent in a physical environment based on functional systems theory,/article/10.1134/S2079059715060131,"We previously developed an adaptive mobile agent control system based on functional systems theory and semantic probabilistic inference (Vityaev, 2008; Demin and Vityaev, 2008). In the present work, we extended the potential of the system by introducing the ability to control a robot in physical environment. On the one hand, this ability shows that the system can operate in the environment that animals function in. On the other hand, it allows testing of the developed algorithm on actual physical environment. We identified two objectives. The first was to extend the capabilities of the system so that it could operate effectively in the physical environment; in particular, it was necessary to add support for continuous sensors and carry out a simulated experiment. The second was to extend the semantic probabilistic inference for the case of continuous sensors. The system was supplemented with abilities to use sensors with continuous real signals and to vary the duration of its actions when selecting a way to achieve the goal. The benefits of the semantic probabilistic inference were preserved. We constructed a robotic platform for experiments in the physical environment. The platform could carry several types of sensors and move according to commands received wirelessly. To show the ability of acting in the physical environment, the system was supposed to learn how to find bricks scattered around the room. The developed algorithm made it possible to solve this task and generate a set of rules for the effective detection of bricks.","N. I. Putintsev, O. V. Isupov, E. E. Vityaev",2015-11-01

This paper describes new functionality in the CARMEN VL: an interactive publications repository. This new facility allows users to link data and software to publications. This enables other users to examine data and software associated with the publication and execute the associated software within the VL using the same data as the authors used in the publication. The cloud-based architecture and SaaS (Software as a Service) framework allows vast data sets to be uploaded and analysed using software services. Thus, this new interactive publications facility allows others to build on research results through reuse. This aligns with recent developments by funding agencies, institutions, and publishers with a move to open access research. Open access provides reproducibility and verification of research resources and results. Publications and their associated data and software will be assured of long-term preservation and curation in the repository. Further, analysing research data and the evaluations described in publications frequently requires a number of execution stages many of which are iterative. The VL provides a scientific workflow environment to combine software services into a processing tree. These workflows can also be associated with publications and executed by users. The VL also provides a secure environment where users can decide the access rights for each resource to ensure copyright and privacy restrictions are met.","Victoria Hodge, Mark Jessop, ...

Ranging from neurological processes to human emotions, the range and scope needed for such ontologies is highly challenging, but if data integration and computational tools such as automated reasoning are to be fully applied in this important area the underlying principles of these ontologies need to be better established and development needs detailed coordination. Whilst the state of scientific knowledge is always paramount in ontology and formal description framework design, this is a particular problem with neurobehavioural ontologies where our understanding of the relationship between behaviour and its underlying biophysical basis is currently in its infancy. In this commentary, we discuss some of the fundamental problems in designing and using behaviour ontologies, and present some of the best developed tools in this domain.","Georgios V.

A more collaborative approach to neuronal model development, inspired by the success of the open source software movement, is required [1]. The Open Source Brain repository (OSB, http://www.opensourcebrain.org) is being developed to enable researchers to collaboratively develop computational models of cells and networks which are well tested and documented and can be run across multiple simulators. This is enabled through the use of advanced distributed version control technologies and by converting the models to open, standardised formats like NeuroML [2], allowing the models to be used by the increasing range of simulators and other applications in the NeuroML ""ecosystem"". The current version of OSB contains models from diverse brain regions including neocortex and cerebellum, invertebrate models as well as more abstract cell and network models. OSB complements existing model archives which have traditionally concentrated on providing snapshots of published models. The cell, ion channel, synapse and network models in OSB develop over time to ensure they reflect known physiology and best practices in modelling.

Aggressive behavior: Genetic and physiological mechanisms,/article/10.1134/S2079059715040085,"The paper presents a review of the literature on the genetic determination of intraspecific aggressive behavior, one of the most complex and universal forms of social behavior in animals on different rungs of the evolutionary ladder. We consider the existing experimental approaches and new opportunities based on recent molecular technologies. The comprehensive approach allows investigating the evolutionary, genetic, and biological roots of aggression and its manifestations under different environmental and social factors, as well as genetic predispositions. The social importance of the problem is noted. The review considers the phenomenology of aggression and mechanisms that stimulate or prevent it. It is supposed that the main social mechanism deterring aggression in a population is the dominance–subordination relationships. Neurobiological determinants of aggression and the role of hereditary factors in controlling aggressive behavior in animals and humans are considered. By the example of neurochemical brain changes in male mice exposed to repeated aggression in daily agonistic intermale interactions, we present the research model “from behavior to the gene.” It is noted in the discussion that the same genes that influence aggressiveness in human were revealed in the experimental studies in animals of different strains, as well as in knockout and transgenic animals. They include genes for transporters supporting serotonin reuptake and enzymes involved in the synthesis and catabolism of serotonin and catecholamines. In conclusion, we consider the prospects of transcriptome studies and problems of the epigenetic regulation of aggressive behavior.","N. N. Kudryavtseva, A. L. Markel, Yu. L. Orlov",2015-07-01

The rise of large-scale imaging studies in psychiatry,/article/10.1186/2047-217X-3-29,"From the initial arguments over whether 12 to 20 subjects were sufficient for an fMRI study, sample sizes in psychiatric neuroimaging studies have expanded into the tens of thousands. These large-scale imaging studies fall into several categories, each of which has specific advantages and challenges. The different study types can be grouped based on their level of control: meta-analyses, at one extreme of the spectrum, control nothing about the imaging protocol or subject selection criteria in the datasets they include, On the other hand, planned multi-site mega studies pour intense efforts into strictly having the same protocols. However, there are several other combinations possible, each of which is best used to address certain questions. The growing investment of all these studies is delivering on the promises of neuroimaging for psychiatry, and holds incredible potential for impact at the level of the individual patient. However, to realize this potential requires both standardized data-sharing efforts, so that there is more staying power in the datasets for re-use and new applications, as well as training the next generation of neuropsychiatric researchers in “Big Data” techniques in addition to traditional experimental methods.

DICOM for Clinical Research: PACS-Integrated Electronic Data Capture in Multi-Center Trials,/article/10.1007/s10278-015-9802-8,"Providing surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, medical imaging has become increasingly important in human-centered research. Nowadays, electronic data capture systems (EDCS) are used but binary image data is integrated insufficiently. There exists no structured way, neither to manage digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) data in EDCS nor to interconnect EDCS with picture archiving and communication systems (PACS). Manual detours in the trial workflow yield errors, delays, and costs. In this paper, requirements for a DICOM-based system interconnection of EDCS and research PACS are analysed. Several workflow architectures are compared. Optimized for multi-center trials, we propose an entirely web-based solution integrating EDCS, PACS, and DICOM viewer, which has been implemented using the open source projects OpenClinica, DCM4CHEE, and Weasis, respectively. The EDCS forms the primary access point. EDCS to PACS interchange is integrated seamlessly on the data and the context levels. DICOM data is viewed directly from the electronic case report form (eCRF), while PACS-based management is hidden from the user. Data privacy is ensured by automatic de-identification and re-labelling with study identifiers. Our concept is evaluated on a variety of 13 DICOM modalities and transfer syntaxes. We have implemented the system in an ongoing investigator-initiated trial (IIT), where five centers have recruited 24 patients so far, performing decentralized computed tomography (CT) screening. Using our system, the chief radiologist is reading DICOM data directly from the eCRF. Errors and workflow processing time are reduced. Furthermore, an imaging database is built that may support future research.","Daniel Haak, Charles-E. Page, ... Thomas M. Deserno",2015-05-23
Myelination-related genes are associated with decreased white matter integrity in schizophrenia,https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2015120,"Disruptions in white matter (WM) tract structures have been implicated consistently in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Global WM integrity – as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) – is highly heritable and may provide a good endophenotype for genetic studies of schizophrenia. WM abnormalities in schizophrenia are not localized to one specific brain region but instead reflect global low-level decreases in FA coupled with focal abnormalities. In this study, we sought to investigate whether functional gene sets associated with schizophrenia are also associated with WM integrity. We analyzed FA and genetic data from the Mind Research Network Clinical Imaging Consortium to study the effect of multiple oligodendrocyte gene sets on schizophrenia and WM integrity using a functional gene set analysis in 77 subjects with schizophrenia and 104 healthy controls. We found that a gene set involved in myelination was significantly associated with schizophrenia and FA. This gene set includes 17 genes that are expressed in oligodendrocytes and one neuronal gene (NRG1) that is known to regulate myelination. None of the genes within the gene set were associated with schizophrenia or FA individually, suggesting that no single gene was driving the association of the gene set. Our findings support the hypothesis that multiple genetic variants in myelination-related genes contribute to the observed correlation between schizophrenia and decreased WM integrity as measured by FA.","Ivan Chavarria-Siles, Tonya White, ...

A locally adaptive time stepping algorithm for the solution to reaction diffusion equations on branched structures,/article/10.1007/s10444-015-9437-9,"In this paper, we present a numerical method for solving reaction-diffusion equations on one dimensional branched structures. Through the use of a simple domain decomposition scheme, the many branches are decoupled so that the equations can be solved as a system of smaller problems that are tri-diagonal. This technique allows for locally adaptive time stepping, in which the time step used in each branch is determined by local activity. Though the method is presented in the specific context of electrical activity in neural systems, it is sufficiently general that it can be applied to other classes of reaction-diffusion problems and higher dimensions. Information in neurons, which can be effectively modeled as one-dimensional branched structures, is carried in the form of electrical impulses called action potentials. The model equations, based on the Hodgkin-Huxley cable equations, are a set of reaction equations coupled to a single diffusion process. Locally adaptive time stepping schemes are well suited to neural simulations due to the spatial localization of activity. The algorithm significantly reduces the computational cost compared to existing methods, especially for large scale simulations.","Richard A. Kublik, David L. Chopp",2016-02-02
Natural-constructive approach to modeling the cognitive process,/article/10.1134/S0006350916010061,"We present a “natural-constructive approach” to modeling the cognitive process, which is based on the dynamic theory of information, the technique of nonlinear differential equations, and the concept of a “dynamic formal neuron.” The version of cognitive architecture that was designed within the natural-constructive approach is presented. One important constructive feature of this architecture consists in splitting up the entire system into two similar hemi-systems (by analogy with the right and left cerebral hemispheres). One of these is responsible for the generation of information and learning, with other one being responsible for the reception and processing of well-known information. This functional specialization is provided by the presence of noise (a random factor) in the generation hemi-system; in the reception hemi-system, all the processes should proceed successively rather than stochastically. The interpretation of the concepts of intuition, logic, consciousness, and sub-consciousness is discussed. The architecture that is designed within the natural-constructive approach is compared with other theoretical approaches (graph theory and the “cognitom” concept), and with anatomical data. The concept of an experiment is proposed that could verify or disprove the main inferences of the natural-constructive approach.","O. D. Chernavskaya, D. S. Chernavskii",2016-01-01

In this paper, we present an overview of artificial devices that model the brain and solve such cognitive tasks as navigation, pattern recognition, routing, and target site finding. We discuss both hybrid systems (hybrots), in which living neural networks control an artificial body, and systems in which such an artificial body is controlled by computer programs based on different models of the brain and its regions (animats). Two basic types of hybrid systems are considered: those in which the robot is connected to the brain of a living body, such as a rat, and those in which information is received from neurons taken from the body or neurons cultured on a microelectrode array detecting their electrical potentials. Among the computational approaches that simulate nervous systems of living organisms, we can mark out the Darwin family of devices based on the theory of neuronal group selection (TNGS). In addition, we consider papers in which animats solve navigation tasks using different models of the rat hippocampus, based on such modeling methods as cognitive graph, view cells, place cells, and experience cells. The approaches under consideration provide researchers with new tools to analyze basic principles of neuron interaction between each other and with the outside world, the principles that provide higher brain functions.","N.

Presently, neuron comparison methods are based on statistics from neuronal morphology such as size and number of branches, which are not fully suitable for detecting local similarities and differences in the detailed structure. We developed BlastNeuron to compare neurons in terms of their global appearance, detailed arborization patterns, and topological similarity. BlastNeuron first compares and clusters 3D neuron reconstructions based on global morphology features and moment invariants, independent of their orientations, sizes, level of reconstruction and other variations. Subsequently, BlastNeuron performs local alignment between any pair of retrieved neurons via a tree-topology driven dynamic programming method. A 3D correspondence map can thus be generated at the resolution of single reconstruction nodes. We applied BlastNeuron to three datasets: (1) 10,000+ neuron reconstructions from a public morphology database, (2) 681 newly and manually reconstructed neurons, and (3) neurons reconstructions produced using several independent reconstruction methods. Our approach was able to accurately and efficiently retrieve morphologically and functionally similar neuron structures from large morphology database, identify the local common structures, and find clusters of neurons that share similarities in both morphology and molecular profiles.","Yinan Wan, Fuhui Long, ...

Experiments in which the consequences of selective inputs on brain activity are controlled and traced with great precision could provide such information. However, such strategies have thus far had limited success. By contrast, recent whole-brain computational modelling approaches have enabled us to start assessing the effect of input perturbations on brain dynamics in silico.","Gustavo Deco, Giulio Tononi, ...

A Network Theory View on the Thalamo-Cortical Loop,/article/10.1007/s11062-015-9463-8,"We used a network theory approach, based on the dynamic core hypothesis (DCH), to study the thalamo-cortical loop (TCL) and its subsets regarding their role in consciousness. We used the Collation of Connectivity Data on the Macaque Brain (CoCoMac) and calculated the degree distributions, transmission coefficients, connection density, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and modularity. Our results showed that the TCL and cortex exhibit exponential degree distributions, and the ratio of efferent/afferent connections in the thalamus is smaller than 1.0 This may support the notion that the connections received by the thalamus from the cortex play a key role in improving information processing in the conscious states. The average values of transmission coefficients for the cortex and TCL were found to be equal to 1.49 and 1.28, respectively. This indicates that: (i) the cortex is a system that mainly transmits information outward rather than receives it; (ii) the TCL is a cooperative system that performs this in a give-and-take manner; (iii) connections of the cortex are denser than those in the TCL, showing that the cortex might be advantageous for processing of complicated information during consciousness; (iv) both the TCL and cortex are small-world systems; (v) the scaled value of the characteristic path length in the TCL is smaller than that in the cortex, which implies a higher speed potential for information processing in the TCL than in the cortex; (vi) the scaled value of the clustering coefficient is nearly the same in the cortex and TCL, and (vii) the number of modules is 5 in the cortex and 6 in the TCL.","F.

A hybrid computational model to predict chemotactic guidance of growth cones,/article/10.1038/srep11340,"The overall strategy used by growing axons to find their correct paths during the nervous system development is not yet completely understood. Indeed, some emergent and counterintuitive phenomena were recently described during axon pathfinding in presence of chemical gradients. Here, a novel computational model is presented together with its ability to reproduce both regular and counterintuitive axonal behaviours. In this model, the key role of intracellular calcium was phenomenologically modelled through a non standard Gierer-Meinhardt system, as a crucial factor influencing the growth cone behaviour both in regular and complex conditions. This model was able to explicitly reproduce neuritic paths accounting for the complex interplay between extracellular and intracellular environments, through the sensing capability of the growth cone. The reliability of this approach was proven by using quantitative metrics, numerically supporting the similarity between in silico and biological results in regular conditions (control and attraction). Finally, the model was able to qualitatively predict emergent and counterintuitive phenomena resulting from complex boundary conditions.","Iolanda Morana Roccasalvo, Silvestro Micera, Pier Nicola Sergi",2015-06-18

Data Persistence Insurance,/article/10.1007/s12021-014-9239-0,"As various journals begin to ratchet up the demands on their authors for including data sharing as part of their manuscript submission process,Footnote 1,Footnote 2 one can see the angst increasing within the neuroscience community. Lots of discussion will continue to transpire about why neuroscience data should or shouldn’t, can or can’t be shared,Footnote 3,Footnote 4 but perhaps we can consider a different approach. Lets say that a neuroscience funding agency would like to take out an insurance policy on the 10-year availability of the raw data acquisition funded by their programs. This is not data ‘sharing’; this is just a guarantee that the specific data acquisitions of a specific funding award are accessible to the specific investigator for a specific period of time.

Comparative analysis of knowledge representation and reasoning requirements across a range of life sciences textbooks,/article/10.1186/2041-1480-5-51,"Using knowledge representation for biomedical projects is now commonplace. In previous work, we represented the knowledge found in a college-level biology textbook in a fashion useful for answering questions. We showed that embedding the knowledge representation and question-answering abilities in an electronic textbook helped to engage student interest and improve learning. A natural question that arises from this success, and this paper’s primary focus, is whether a similar approach is applicable across a range of life science textbooks. To answer that question, we considered four different textbooks, ranging from a below-introductory college biology text to an advanced, graduate-level neuroscience textbook. For these textbooks, we investigated the following questions: (1) To what extent is knowledge shared between the different textbooks? (2) To what extent can the same upper ontology be used to represent the knowledge found in different textbooks? (3) To what extent can the questions of interest for a range of textbooks be answered by using the same reasoning mechanisms?","Vinay K Chaudhri, Daniel Elenius, ... Neil Yorke-Smith",2014-12-18
Defining Computational Thinking for Mathematics and Science Classrooms,/article/10.1007/s10956-015-9581-5,"Science and mathematics are becoming computational endeavors. This fact is reflected in the recently released Next Generation Science Standards and the decision to include “computational thinking” as a core scientific practice. With this addition, and the increased presence of computation in mathematics and scientific contexts, a new urgency has come to the challenge of defining computational thinking and providing a theoretical grounding for what form it should take in school science and mathematics classrooms. This paper presents a response to this challenge by proposing a definition of computational thinking for mathematics and science in the form of a taxonomy consisting of four main categories: data practices, modeling and simulation practices, computational problem solving practices, and systems thinking practices. In formulating this taxonomy, we draw on the existing computational thinking literature, interviews with mathematicians and scientists, and exemplary computational thinking instructional materials. This work was undertaken as part of a larger effort to infuse computational thinking into high school science and mathematics curricular materials. In this paper, we argue for the approach of embedding computational thinking in mathematics and science contexts, present the taxonomy, and discuss how we envision the taxonomy being used to bring current educational efforts in line with the increasingly computational nature of modern science and mathematics.","David Weintrop, Elham Beheshti, ...

The basic goal of Health Informatics is to take in real world medical data from all levels of human existence to help advance our understanding of medicine and medical practice. This paper will present recent research using Big Data tools and approaches for the analysis of Health Informatics data gathered at multiple levels, including the molecular, tissue, patient, and population levels. In addition to gathering data at multiple levels, multiple levels of questions are addressed: human-scale biology, clinical-scale, and epidemic-scale. We will also analyze and examine possible future work for each of these areas, as well as how combining data from each level may provide the most promising approach to gain the most knowledge in Health Informatics.","Matthew Herland, Taghi M Khoshgoftaar, Randall Wald",2014-06-24

Robust Intensity Standardization in Brain Magnetic Resonance Images,/article/10.1007/s10278-015-9782-8,"The paper is focused on a tiSsue-Based Standardization Technique (SBST) of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. Magnetic Resonance Imaging intensities have no fixed tissue-specific numeric meaning, even within the same MRI protocol, for the same body region, or even for images of the same patient obtained on the same scanner in different moments. This affects postprocessing tasks such as automatic segmentation or unsupervised/supervised classification methods, which strictly depend on the observed image intensities, compromising the accuracy and efficiency of many image analyses algorithms. A large number of MR images from public databases, belonging to healthy people and to patients with different degrees of neurodegenerative pathology, were employed together with synthetic MRIs. Combining both histogram and tissue-specific intensity information, a correspondence is obtained for each tissue across images. The novelty consists of computing three standardizing transformations for the three main brain tissues, for each tissue class separately. In order to create a continuous intensity mapping, spline smoothing of the overall slightly discontinuous piecewise-linear intensity transformation is performed. The robustness of the technique is assessed in a post hoc manner, by verifying that automatic segmentation of images before and after standardization gives a high overlapping (Dice index >0.9) for each tissue class, even across images coming from different sources. Furthermore, SBST efficacy is tested by evaluating if and how much it increases intertissue discrimination and by assessing gaussianity of tissue gray-level distributions before and after standardization. Some quantitative comparisons to already existing different approaches available in the literature are performed.","Giorgio De Nunzio, Rosella Cataldo, Alessandra Carlà",2015-02-24

A Connectome Computation System for discovery science of brain,/article/10.1007/s11434-014-0698-3,"Much like genomics, brain connectomics has rapidly become a core component of most national brain projects around the world. Beyond the ambitious aims of these projects, a fundamental challenge is the need for an efficient, robust, reliable and easy-to-use pipeline to mine such large neuroscience datasets. Here, we introduce a computational pipeline—namely the Connectome Computation System (CCS)—for discovery science of human brain connectomes at the macroscale with multimodal magnetic resonance imaging technologies. The CCS is designed with a three-level hierarchical structure that includes data cleaning and preprocessing, individual connectome mapping and connectome mining, and knowledge discovery. Several functional modules are embedded into this hierarchy to implement quality control procedures, reliability analysis and connectome visualization. We demonstrate the utility of the CCS based upon a publicly available dataset, the NKI–Rockland Sample, to delineate the normative trajectories of well-known large-scale neural networks across the natural life span (6–85 years of age). The CCS has been made freely available to the public via GitHub (https://github.com/zuoxinian/CCS) and our laboratory’s Web site (http://lfcd.psych.ac.cn/ccs.html) to facilitate progress in discovery science in the field of human brain connectomics.","Ting Xu, Zhi Yang, ...

Some features of the sound-signal envelope extracted by cochlear nucleus neurons in grass frog,/article/10.1134/S0006350915030045,"The responses of single neurons in the medullar auditory center of the grass frog were recorded extracellularly under the action of long tone signals of a characteristic frequency that were modulated by repeating fragments of low-frequency (0–15, 0–50 or 0–150 Hz) noise. The correlation method was used for evaluating the strength of the effect of different envelope fragments to ensure the generation of a neuron pulse discharge. While carrying out these evaluations at different time intervals, the maximum delays were assessed between a signal and a response. Two important envelope fragments were revealed. In the majority of units the most effective fragment was the time interval of the amplitude increase from the mean value to the maximum; the fragment where the amplitude fell from the maximum to the mean value was the second in the strength of the effect. This type of response was observed in the vast majority of cells in the range of the envelope frequency bands 0–150 and 0–50 Hz. These cells performed half-wave rectification of this type of envelope. However, in some neurons we observed a stronger strength of the reaction toward a time interval with a increasing amplitude, even including those where the amplitude value was smaller than the mean one. These properties were observed mainly for low-frequency (0–15 Hz) modulated signals at high modulation depth. The data show that even in the medulla oblongata specialization of neural elements of the auditory pathway occurs with respect to the time interval features of the sound stimulus. This diversity is most evident for signals with relatively slowly varying amplitudes.",N. G. Bibikov,2015-05-01
Interacting with the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) via the LONI Pipeline workflow environment,/article/10.1007/s11682-015-9354-z,"Under the umbrella of the National Database for Clinical Trials (NDCT) related to mental illnesses, the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) seeks to gather, curate, and make openly available neuroimaging data from NIH-funded studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). NDAR has recently made its database accessible through the LONI Pipeline workflow design and execution environment to enable large-scale analyses of cortical architecture and function via local, cluster, or “cloud”-based computing resources. This presents a unique opportunity to overcome many of the customary limitations to fostering biomedical neuroimaging as a science of discovery. Providing open access to primary neuroimaging data, workflow methods, and high-performance computing will increase uniformity in data collection protocols, encourage greater reliability of published data, results replication, and broaden the range of researchers now able to perform larger studies than ever before. To illustrate the use of NDAR and LONI Pipeline for performing several commonly performed neuroimaging processing steps and analyses, this paper presents example workflows useful for ASD neuroimaging researchers seeking to begin using this valuable combination of online data and computational resources. We discuss the utility of such database and workflow processing interactivity as a motivation for the sharing of additional primary data in ASD research and elsewhere.","Carinna M.

Template Construction Grammar: From Visual Scene Description to Language Comprehension and Agrammatism,/article/10.1007/s12021-013-9197-y,"How does the language system coordinate with our visual system to yield flexible integration of linguistic, perceptual, and world-knowledge information when we communicate about the world we perceive? Schema theory is a computational framework that allows the simulation of perceptuo-motor coordination programs on the basis of known brain operating principles such as cooperative computation and distributed processing. We present first its application to a model of language production, SemRep/TCG, which combines a semantic representation of visual scenes (SemRep) with Template Construction Grammar (TCG) as a means to generate verbal descriptions of a scene from its associated SemRep graph. SemRep/TCG combines the neurocomputational framework of schema theory with the representational format of construction grammar in a model linking eye-tracking data to visual scene descriptions. We then offer a conceptual extension of TCG to include language comprehension and address data on the role of both world knowledge and grammatical semantics in the comprehension performances of agrammatic aphasic patients. This extension introduces a distinction between heavy and light semantics. The TCG model of language comprehension offers a computational framework to quantitatively analyze the distributed dynamics of language processes, focusing on the interactions between grammatical, world knowledge, and visual information. In particular, it reveals interesting implications for the understanding of the various patterns of comprehension performances of agrammatic aphasics measured using sentence-picture matching tasks. This new step in the life cycle of the model serves as a basis for exploring the specific challenges that neurolinguistic computational modeling poses to the neuroinformatics community.","Victor Barrès, Jinyong Lee",2013-07-27

We first explore the use of the proximal gradient (PG) method to solving binary-class HSVM (B-HSVM) and then generalize it to multi-class HSVM (M-HSVM). Under strong convexity assumptions, we show that our algorithm converges linearly. In addition, we give a finite convergence result about the support of the solution, based on which we further accelerate the algorithm by a two-stage method.

Electrophysiological activity of the brain of the mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis L. after cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen (−196°C),/article/10.1134/S1990747814050043,"The study of the reversible suspension of the vital activity of neurons, as a part of nervous tissue, after their cryopreservation, is new and in demand. Long-term storage of a viable material at a temperature of liquid nitrogen (−196°C) opens new opportunities for biomedicine in the field of the establishment of cryobanks for nerve tissue transplants. In this work, the recovery of the electrophysiological activity of neurons after deep freezing, by an example of ganglia of the brain of the mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis L. was studied. The comparison of electric characteristics (membrane potentials, action potentials) of identified neurons of different ganglia was carried out in an organotypic culture of the mollusk cryopreserved brain and the brain not exposed to cryopreservation. The preservation of functional connections between identified RPeD1 interneurons of the pedal ganglion, interneurons VD1, VD4 and the area of the VA-cluster of the visceral ganglion was analyzed. The influence of a cryoprotector dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) on functional connections between the identified neurons of the mollusk brain was studied. It was shown that the typical patterns of electric activity of neurons were restored after cryopreservation of the mollusk brain; neurons generated postsynaptic potentials (PSP), but functionally active connections between the identified neurons of different ganglia were not found. DMSO did not influence the functioning of connections between the neurons localized in different ganglia. Interruption of some connections between neurons could be caused by cryodamages in the neuropil and commissures, which is confirmed by the presence of the PSP of an atypical profile.","N. A.

Here, we develop a novel framework to capture a complete set of shape differences in the CC between congenitally blind (CB), late blind (LB) and sighted control (SC) groups. The CCs were manually segmented from T1-weighted brain MRI and modeled by 3D tetrahedral meshes. We statistically compared the combination of local area and thickness at each point between subject groups. Differences in area are found using surface tensor-based morphometry; thickness is estimated by tracing the streamlines in the volumetric harmonic field. Group differences were assessed on this combined measure using Hotelling’s T
2 test. Interestingly, we observed that the total callosal volume did not differ between the groups. However, our fine-grained analysis reveals significant differences mostly localized around the splenium areas between both blind groups and the sighted group (general effects of blindness) and, importantly, specific dissimilarities between the LB and CB groups, illustrating the existence of a sensitive period for reorganization. The new multivariate statistics also gave better effect sizes for detecting morphometric differences, relative to other statistics. They may boost statistical power for CC morphometric analyses.","Jie Shi, Olivier Collignon, ... Yalin Wang",2015-02-04

Neuroimaging and genetics in aging and age-related disease,/article/10.1007/s11682-014-9299-7,"Neuroimaging, genetics, and phenomic explorations in the study of brain aging seek to characterize typical patterns of morphometric, function, and connectomics and how these change over the lifespan. With a detailed but multifaceted knowledge of these patterns, neuroscientists and clinicians can better recognize the processes at play when age-related brain changes vary from these expectations. Employing a range of neuroimaging methods, genome-wide as well as focused gene targeting, and ‘big data’ computation, progress is occurring toward gaining such understanding.

Bio-inspired neurodynamics-based cascade tracking control for automated guided vehicles,/article/10.1007/s00170-014-6007-0,"Nowadays, the automated guided vehicles (AGV) have been widely used with increasing missions in a variety of fields such as the industry, military, and research. Due to the nonholonomic constraints, fulfilling satisfactory control of the AGV becomes a big challenge. In the present work, a bio-inspired neurodynamics-based cascade tracking control strategy was proposed. Specifically, the bio-inspired neurodynamics module was utilized to generate smooth forward velocities for overcoming the sharp velocity jump. Moreover, with the cascade tracking approach, the nonholonomic system was transformed into a chained system. Additionally, a state differential feedback controller was applied to improve the tracking accuracy. Finally, simulation investigations based on Matlab codes with various parameter settings were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The simulation results showed that the proposed strategy in the present work is able to produce accurate, smooth, robust, and globally stable control for the AGV.","Xiao-Hong Yin, Can Yang, Dan Xiong",2014-06-06

Towards the abstract system theory of system science for cognitive and intelligent systems,/article/10.1007/s40747-015-0001-5,"Basic studies in system science explore the theories, principles, and properties of abstract and concrete systems as well as their applications in system engineering. Systems are the most complicated entities and phenomena in abstract, physical, information, cognitive, brain, and social worlds across a wide range of science and engineering disciplines. The mathematical model of a general system is embodied as a hyperstructure of the abstract system. The theoretical framework of system science is formally described by a set of algebraic operations on abstract systems known as system algebra. A set of abstract structures, properties, behaviors, and principles is rigorously formalized in contemporary system theories. Applications of the formal theories of system science in system engineering, intelligent engineering, cognitive informatics, cognitive robotics, software engineering, cognitive linguistics, and cognitive computing are demonstrated, which reveals how system structural and behavioral complexities may be efficiently reduced in system representation, modeling, analysis, synthesis, inference, and implementation.",Yingxu Wang,2015-06-23

Identification of coronal sources of the solar wind from solar images in the EUV spectral range,/article/10.1134/S0010952515010074,"Methods of localizing coronal sources of the solar wind (SW), such as coronal holes, quasi-stationary fluxes from active regions, and transient sources associated with small-scale active phenomena are considered based on vacuum-ultraviolet (EUV) images of the corona at low solar activity during the initial period of the 24th solar cycle (2010). It is shown that a SW velocity profile can be calculated from the relative areas of coronal holes (CH) at the central part of the disk based on the images in the ranges of 193 and 171 Å. The images in the 193 Å describe the geometry of large HCs that represent sources of fast SW well. The images in 171 Å are a better visualization of small CHs, based on which the profile of a slow SW component was calculated to a high accuracy (up to 65 km/s). According to Hinode/EIS data of October 15, 2010, using the Doppler spectroscopy method at the streamer base over the active region 11112, the source of the outgoing plasma flux with the mean velocity of 17 km/s was localized in the magnetic field region with an intensity of less than 200 Gauss. According to the estimate, the density of the plasma flux from this source is an order of magnitude greater than the value required for explaining the distinction between the calculated and measured profiles of a slow SW velocity. For finding the transient SW component based on small-scale flare activity, SW parameters were analyzed for the periods of flares accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and for the periods without flares, according to the data obtained in 2010 from the ACE and GOES satellites and by coronagraphs on the STEREO-A and -B spacecraft. The ion ratios C+6/C+5 and O+7/O+6 and the mean charge of Fe ions for periods with flares were shown to be shifted toward large values, suggesting the presence of a hot SW component associated with flare activity. A noticeable correlation between the maximum charge of Fe ions and the peak power of a flare, previously observed for flares of a higher class, was confirmed. The mean value of the SW flux density during the periods of flares was 30% higher than that in the periods without flares, which is possibly associated also with the growth of fluxes from other sources with an increasing solar activity level. Based on the example of a series of flares of October 13–14, 2010, it was supposed that transient SW fluxes from the weak flares at low solar activity can manifest themselves in the form of interplanetary ICME-transients.","V.

Ontogenetic Ritualization of Primate Gesture as a Case Study in Dyadic Brain Modeling,/article/10.1007/s12021-013-9182-5,"This paper introduces dyadic brain modeling – the simultaneous, computational modeling of the brains of two interacting agents – to explore ways in which our understanding of macaque brain circuitry can ground new models of brain mechanisms involved in ape interaction. Specifically, we assess a range of data on gestural communication of great apes as the basis for developing an account of the interactions of two primates engaged in ontogenetic ritualization, a proposed learning mechanism through which a functional action may become a communicative gesture over repeated interactions between two individuals (the ‘dyad’). The integration of behavioral, neural, and computational data in dyadic (or, more generally, social) brain modeling has broad application to comparative and evolutionary questions, particularly for the evolutionary origins of cognition and language in the human lineage. We relate this work to the neuroinformatics challenges of integrating and sharing data to support collaboration between primatologists, neuroscientists and modelers that will help speed the emergence of what may be called comparative neuro-primatology.","Brad Gasser, Erica A.

Svein G Dahl,/article/10.1038/npp.2013.267,"Svein Dahl, Professor and Chair of Pharmacology at the University of Tromsø, and an ACNP Fellow, succumbed to cancer on 8 December 2012. He died at his home near Tromsø, Norway, the city where he was born in 1942. Svein spent his entire professional life in the faculty at the University of Tromsø, having been appointed in 1976 immediately after obtaining his PhD in Pharmacology from the University of Oslo. Besides creating and maintaining a highly productive psychopharmacology research group in Norway, Svein expanded his capabilities and network of collaborators through a series of sabbaticals. These included stays at Synthelabo in Paris, the University of California, San Francisco, the Université René Descartes, the Université de Creteil, and at the C.N.R.S. in Montpellier. From 1994 to 1997 he was Research Director at the Institut de Recherche Jouveinal/Parke Davis while maintaining his faculty position. The breadth of his scientific interests and skills are evidenced by his substantive contributions to basic and clinical psychopharmacology. He was an early pioneer in combining computational and molecular graphics techniques to generate three-dimensional models of drug targets and to simulate drug–receptor interactions. Using this approach, he was the first to construct a complete model of a G protein-coupled receptor. His work provided important insights into the molecular dynamics of the interaction of antipsychotics with the dopamine D2 receptor, drug attachment to monoamine transporters, and the actions of antidepressants. In recent years he expanded his work to create pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models to explain and predict therapeutic and toxic responses to drugs. Svein’s work is described in seven patents, eight books, and scores of research and review articles. Among the honors he received were appointments to the Governing Board of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility, the Council of Scientists of the Human Frontier Science Program, and the Steering Group of the Norwegian Research Council’s NevroNor Initiative. Besides his scientific interests, Svein was an accomplished saxophonist and an avid fan of jazz history and music. Until the very end he continued performing with his jazz group in Tromsø. His enthusiasm for science and music, as well as his creativity, self-effacing personality, and dry wit endeared him to legions of students, co-workers and colleagues across the globe. An ACNP member since 1990, Svein contributed significantly to the College and the discipline, and enriched the lives of all who knew him.

Whole-body tissue stabilization and selective extractions via tissue-hydrogel hybrids for high-resolution intact circuit mapping and phenotyping,/article/10.1038/nprot.2015.122,"To facilitate fine-scale phenotyping of whole specimens, we describe here a set of tissue fixation-embedding, detergent-clearing and staining protocols that can be used to transform excised organs and whole organisms into optically transparent samples within 1–2 weeks without compromising their cellular architecture or endogenous fluorescence. PACT (passive CLARITY technique) and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ) use tissue-hydrogel hybrids to stabilize tissue biomolecules during selective lipid extraction, resulting in enhanced clearing efficiency and sample integrity. Furthermore, the macromolecule permeability of PACT- and PARS-processed tissue hybrids supports the diffusion of immunolabels throughout intact tissue, whereas RIMS (refractive index matching solution) grants high-resolution imaging at depth by further reducing light scattering in cleared and uncleared samples alike. These methods are adaptable to difficult-to-image tissues, such as bone (PACT-deCAL), and to magnified single-cell visualization (ePACT). Together, these protocols and solutions enable phenotyping of subcellular components and tracing cellular connectivity in intact biological networks.","Jennifer B Treweek, Ken Y Chan, ...

Information Processing in the Mirror Neuron System in Primates and Machines,/article/10.1007/s12021-013-9200-7,"The mirror neuron system in primates matches observations of actions with the motor representations used for their execution, and is a topic of intense research and debate in biological and computational disciplines. In robotics, models of this system have been used for enabling robots to imitate and learn how to perform tasks from human demonstrations. Yet, existing computational and robotic models of these systems are found in multiple levels of description, and although some models offer plausible explanations and testable predictions, the difference in the granularity of the experimental setups, methodologies, computational structures and selected modeled data make principled meta-analyses, common in other fields, difficult. In this paper, we adopt an interdisciplinary approach, using the BODB integrated environment in order to bring together several different but complementary computational models, by functionally decomposing them into brain operating principles (BOPs) which each capture a limited subset of the model’s functionality. We then explore links from these BOPs to neuroimaging and neurophysiological data in order to pinpoint complementary and conflicting explanations and compare predictions against selected sets of neurobiological data. The results of this comparison are used to interpret mirror system neuroimaging results in terms of neural network activity, evaluate the biological plausibility of mirror system models, and suggest new experiments that can shed light on the neural basis of mirror systems.","Yiannis Demiris, Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, James Bonaiuto",2013-10-02

Scoring the collective effects of SNPs: association of minor alleles with complex traits in model organisms,/article/10.1007/s11427-014-4704-4,"It has long been assumed that most parts of a genome and most genetic variations or SNPs are non-functional with regard to reproductive fitness. However, the collective effects of SNPs have yet to be examined by experimental science. We here developed a novel approach to examine the relationship between traits and the total amount of SNPs in panels of genetic reference populations. We identified the minor alleles (MAs) in each panel and the MA content (MAC) that each inbred strain carried for a set of SNPs with genotypes determined in these panels. MAC was nearly linearly linked to quantitative variations in numerous traits in model organisms, including life span, tumor susceptibility, learning and memory, sensitivity to alcohol and anti-psychotic drugs, and two correlated traits poor reproductive fitness and strong immunity. These results suggest that the collective effects of SNPs are functional and do affect reproductive fitness.","DeJian Yuan, ZuoBin Zhu, ... Shi Huang",2014-08-07
Human neuroimaging as a “Big Data” science,/article/10.1007/s11682-013-9255-y,"The maturation of in vivo neuroimaging has led to incredible quantities of digital information about the human brain.

A range of neuroimaging databasing approaches has streamlined the transmission, storage, and dissemination of data from such brain imaging studies. Yet few, if any, common solutions exist to support the science of neuroimaging. In this article, we discuss how modern neuroimaging research represents a multifactorial and broad ranging data challenge, involving the growing size of the data being acquired; sociological and logistical sharing issues; infrastructural challenges for multi-site, multi-datatype archiving; and the means by which to explore and mine these data. As neuroimaging advances further, e.g. aging, genetics, and age-related disease, new vision is needed to manage and process this information while marshalling of these resources into novel results.

The connectome of the basal ganglia,/article/10.1007/s00429-014-0936-0,"The basal ganglia of the laboratory rat consist of a few core regions that are specifically interconnected by efferents and afferents of the central nervous system. In nearly 800 reports of tract-tracing investigations the connectivity of the basal ganglia is documented. The readout of connectivity data and the collation of all the connections of these reports in a database allows to generate a connectome. The collation, curation and analysis of such a huge amount of connectivity data is a great challenge and has not been performed before (Bohland et al. PloS One 4:e7200, 2009) in large connectomics projects based on meta-analysis of tract-tracing studies. Here, the basal ganglia connectome of the rat has been generated and analyzed using the consistent cross-platform and generic framework neuroVIISAS. Several advances of this connectome meta-study have been made: the collation of laterality data, the network-analysis of connectivity strengths and the assignment of regions to a hierarchically organized terminology. The basal ganglia connectome offers differences in contralateral connectivity of motoric regions in contrast to other regions. A modularity analysis of the weighted and directed connectome produced a specific grouping of regions. This result indicates a correlation of structural and functional subsystems. As a new finding, significant reciprocal connections of specific network motifs in this connectome were detected. All three principal basal ganglia pathways (direct, indirect, hyperdirect) could be determined in the connectome. By identifying these pathways it was found that there exist many further equivalent pathways possessing the same length and mean connectivity weight as the principal pathways. Based on the connectome data it is unknown why an excitation pattern may prefer principal rather than other equivalent pathways. In addition to these new findings the local graph-theoretical features of regions of the connectome have been determined. By performing graph theoretical analyses it turns out that beside the caudate putamen further regions like the mesencephalic reticular formation, amygdaloid complex and ventral tegmental area are important nodes in the basal ganglia connectome. The connectome data of this meta-study of tract-tracing reports of the basal ganglia are available for further network studies, the integration into neocortical connectomes and further extensive investigations of the basal ganglia dynamics in population simulations.","Oliver Schmitt, Peter Eipert, ...

Accelerating The Virtual Brain with code generation and GPU computing,/article/10.1186/1471-2202-14-S1-P198,"The genesis of both theory of neural field modeling and forward solutions for neuroimaging modalities and empirical methods to obtain connectivity datasets necessary to simulate the human brain dynamics has lead to the development of a whole-brain simulator, built within a freely available neuroinformatics platform called the Virtual Brain (TVB) [1–3]. TVB and the research that led to it, has opened up several possibilities as well as further research questions. On the one hand, such simulations reproduce aspects of human resting state activity, and on the other, it has been observed that certain neural pathologies manifest changes in the resting state, therefore suggesting that the Virtual Brain presents an opportunity to model the dynamics of a brain, on a case by case basis, enabled by non-invasive tractography methods such as diffusion tensor or spectrum imaging. Other use cases are also possible, e.g. in the case of stroke patients to model the effects of resulting lesions on resting state dynamics. However, obstacles remain: First, the relative effects of the parameters on the network model stability and its associated parameter dispersion in TVB are not well understood, and second, because of realism of finite conduction velocities in the brain connectivity in TVB, the models remain computationally expensive. In the work presented here, we address both obstacles in computational terms by introducing and implementing strategies to improve the performance of the simulator in TVB, based on generating customized code per simulation [4]. These improvements are drastic when access to recent graphics processing units (GPUs) is available and represent orders of magnitude increase in the ability of users to explore both parameter spaces or qualitative dynamical regimes, and therefore significantly amplify the impact of whole-brain modeling approaches.","M Marmaduke Woodman, Viktor K Jirsa",2013-07-08

A mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain,/article/10.1038/nature13186,"Comprehensive knowledge of the brain’s wiring diagram is fundamental for understanding how the nervous system processes information at both local and global scales. However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.","Seung Wook Oh, Julie A.

Group-Wise FMRI Activation Detection on DICCCOL Landmarks,/article/10.1007/s12021-014-9226-5,"Group-wise activation detection in task-based fMRI has been widely used because of its robustness to noises and its capacity to deal with variability of individual brains. However, current group-wise fMRI activation detection methods typically rely on the co-registration of individual brains’ fMRI images, which has difficulty in dealing with the remarkable anatomic variation of different brains. As a consequence, the resulted misalignments could significantly degrade the required inter-subject correspondences, thus substantially reducing the sensitivity and specificity of group-wise fMRI activation detection. To deal with these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach to detecting group-wise fMRI activation on our recently developed and validated Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks (DICCCOL). The basic idea here is that the first-level general linear model (GLM) analysis is first performed on the fMRI signal of each corresponding DICCCOL landmark in individual brain’s own space, and then the estimated effect sizes of the same landmark from a group of subjects are statistically assessed with the mixed-effect model at the group level. Finally, the consistently activated DICCCOL landmarks are determined and declared in a group-wise fashion in response to external block-based stimuli. Our experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach can detect meaningful activations.","Jinglei Lv, Lei Guo, ... Tianming Liu",2014-04-29

On the existence of spontaneous neuronal bursting activity at the periphery of the amphibian auditory pathway,/article/10.1134/S0022093013060054,"The firing activity of 104 neurons from the medullar dorsal nucleus (homologous to the mammalian cochlear nucleus complex) of immobilized common frogs (Rana t. temporaria) was recorded extracellularly in the absence of external auditory stimuli. This background activity was analyzed by using stochastic point process parameters such as the coefficient of variation, local coefficient of variation, interdependence of neighboring intervals, interpulse interval distribution, autocorrelation, and hazard function. All these parameters were put in correspondence with bursting rate, i.e., relative number of interpulse intervals grouped in clusters, or bursts, determined by the proposed method. Neurons with pronounced refractoriness, as a rule, exhibited lower bursting rates whereas neurons with a distinct maximum of the correlation function showed higher values than expected from a random Poisson process. However, even in the latter group of cells, bursting rates usually did not decrease after random shuffling of all the interpulse intervals. As a result, we must admit the absence of clustered spontaneous activity in second-order auditory neurons in the amphibian species studied. These data are compared with the specificities of spontaneous firing activity in different parts of the mammalian auditory pathway.",N. G. Bibikov,2013-11-01

Better living through transparency: Improving the reproducibility of fMRI results through comprehensive methods reporting,/article/10.3758/s13415-013-0188-0,"Recent studies suggest that a greater proportion of published scientific findings than expected cannot be replicated. The field of functional neuroimaging research is no exception to this trend, with estimates of false positive results ranging from 10 % to 40 %. While false positive results in neuroimaging studies stem from a variety of causes, incomplete methodological reporting is perhaps the most obvious: Most published reports of neuroimaging studies provide ambiguous or incomplete descriptions of their methods and results. If neuroimaging researchers do not report methods and results in adequate detail, independent scientists can neither check their work for errors nor accurately replicate their efforts. Thus, I argue that comprehensive methods reporting is essential for reproducible research. I recommend three strategies for improving transparency and reproducibility in neuroimaging research: improving natural language descriptions of research protocols; sharing source code for data collection and analysis; and sharing formal, machine-readable representations of methods and results. Last, I discuss the technological and cultural barriers to implementing these recommendations and suggest steps toward overcoming those barriers.",Joshua Carp,2013-07-10

An Informatics Approach to Integrating Genetic and Neurological Data in Speech and Language Neuroscience,/article/10.1007/s12021-013-9201-6,"A number of heritable disorders impair the normal development of speech and language processes and occur in large numbers within the general population. While candidate genes and loci have been identified, the gap between genotype and phenotype is vast, limiting current understanding of the biology of normal and disordered processes. This gap exists not only in our scientific knowledge, but also in our research communities, where genetics researchers and speech, language, and cognitive scientists tend to operate independently. Here we describe a web-based, domain-specific, curated database that represents information about genotype-phenotype relations specific to speech and language disorders, as well as neuroimaging results demonstrating focal brain differences in relevant patients versus controls. Bringing these two distinct data types into a common database (http://neurospeech.org/sldb) is a first step toward bringing molecular level information into cognitive and computational theories of speech and language function. One bridge between these data types is provided by densely sampled profiles of gene expression in the brain, such as those provided by the Allen Brain Atlases. Here we present results from exploratory analyses of human brain gene expression profiles for genes implicated in speech and language disorders, which are annotated in our database. We then discuss how such datasets can be useful in the development of computational models that bridge levels of analysis, necessary to provide a mechanistic understanding of heritable language disorders. We further describe our general approach to information integration, discuss important caveats and considerations, and offer a specific but speculative example based on genes implicated in stuttering and basal ganglia function in speech motor control.","Jason W.

Stimulus-induced transition of clustering firings in neuronal networks with information transmission delay,/article/10.1140/epjb/e2013-40078-3,"We study the evolution of spatiotemporal dynamics and transition of clustering firing synchronization on spiking Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks as information transmission delay and the periodic stimulus are varied. In particular, it is shown that the tuned information transmission delay can induce a clustering anti-phase synchronization transition with the pacemaker, where two equal clusters can alternatively synchronize in anti-phase firing. More interestingly, we show that the periodic stimulus can drive the delay-induced clustering anti-phase firing synchronization bifurcate to the collective perfect synchronization, which is routed by the complex process including collective chaotic firings and clustering out-of-phase synchronization of the neuronal networks. In addition, the periodic stimulus induced clustering firings of the spiking neuronal networks are robust to the connectivity probability of small world networks. Furthermore, the different stimulus frequency induced complexity is also investigated. We hope that the results of this paper can provide insights that could facilitate the understanding of the joint impact of information transmission delays and periodic stimulus on controlling dynamical behaviors of realistic neuronal networks.","Qingyun Wang, Honghui Zhang, Guanrong Chen",2013-07-01

A Simplified CPGs Network with Phase Oscillator Model for Locomotion Control of a Snake-like Robot,/article/10.1007/s10846-013-9868-9,"CPG (Central pattern generator) is a dynamical system of coupled nonlinear oscillators or neural networks inspired by a control mechanism in animal bodies. Without any rhythmic inputs, the CPG has the ability to produce oscillatory patterns. This paper presents a novel structure of a CPG network which can produce rhythmic motion that imitates movement of animals such as snake and lamprey. The focus is on the locomotion control of a snake-like robot, where phase oscillator has been adopted as the dynamical model to control the harmonic motion of the CPG network. There are two main points addressed in this paper: (1) simple network structure of unidirectional coupling oscillators, and  (2) a single parameter to control the body shape and to control the forward and backward movement of the snake-like robot. The proposed CPG network is designed to have a simple structure with less complexity, less mathematical computation, fast convergence speed and exhibit limit cycle behavior. In addition, a new parameter, τ is introduced to control the smoothness of the CPG output as well as the speed of the snake-like robot. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed CPG network can be used to control the serpentine locomotion of a snake-like robot.","Norzalilah Mohamad Nor, Shugen Ma",2013-08-08

Alpha and Beta Oscillations in the Dynamics of the Areas and Weightings of the Receptive Fields of Striate Neurons in Cats in Classical and Combined Mapping,/article/10.1007/s11055-013-9751-y,"Acute experiments on 22 anesthetized and immobilized cats were performed to produce dynamic time-slices maps of 83 on and/or off receptive fields of 47 visual cortex field 17 neurons using classical and combined mapping. These experiments showed that the areas and weightings of neuron fields during response generation using classical mapping changed in a wavelike manner. Mathematical processing of these data showed that the dynamics of receptive field characteristics consisted of the sum of a slow aperiodic and a rapid periodic component. The slow aperiodic component showed biphasic receptive field dynamics. The oscillation frequency of the periodic component in most cases was distributed into the alpha and, more rarely, beta EEG ranges. Additional activation of the discharge center of the receptive field of the neuron in combined mapping had no effect on the frequency of periodic oscillations but elicited significant reductions in the duration and amplitude of the aperiodic component. The mechanisms underlying the dynamics of neuron receptive fields in the primary visual cortex are discussed, as is the functional significance of these dynamics.","N. A. Lazareva, S. A.

On brain activity mapping: insights and lessons from Brain Decoding Project to map memory patterns in the hippocampus,/article/10.1007/s11427-013-4521-1,"The BRAIN project recently announced by the president Obama is the reflection of unrelenting human quest for cracking the brain code, the patterns of neuronal activity that define who we are and what we are. While the Brain Activity Mapping proposal has rightly emphasized on the need to develop new technologies for measuring every spike from every neuron, it might be helpful to consider both the theoretical and experimental aspects that would accelerate our search for the organizing principles of the brain code. Here we share several insights and lessons from the similar proposal, namely, Brain Decoding Project that we initiated since 2007. We provide a specific example in our initial mapping of real-time memory traces from one part of the memory circuit, namely, the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. We show how innovative behavioral tasks and appropriate mathematical analyses of large datasets can play equally, if not more, important roles in uncovering the specific-to-general feature-coding cell assembly mechanism by which episodic memory, semantic knowledge, and imagination are generated and organized. Our own experiences suggest that the bottleneck of the Brain Project is not only at merely developing additional new technologies, but also the lack of efficient avenues to disseminate cutting edge platforms and decoding expertise to neuroscience community. Therefore, we propose that in order to harness unique insights and extensive knowledge from various investigators working in diverse neuroscience subfields, ranging from perception and emotion to memory and social behaviors, the BRAIN project should create a set of International and National Brain Decoding Centers at which cutting-edge recording technologies and expertise on analyzing large datasets analyses can be made readily available to the entire community of neuroscientists who can apply and schedule to perform cutting-edge research.","Joe Z.

The metabolism of monoamines in the central nervous system during compensated and decompensated heart failure,/article/10.1134/S1819712413010066,"We found different associations between disturbances in the brain and heart during compensated and decompensated heart failure. Changes in the content of monoamines (MAs) in the brain at different stages of heart failure (HF) were related to different causes. The increased activity of MA-ergic systems during compensated HF was apparently associated with the functional load that is experienced by the structures of the brain during the development of cerebral processes of autonomic regulation of the compensatory function of the heart. Cerebral hemodynamics in patients with decompensated HF leads to a decrease in the activities of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and a permanent mismatch of the central and autonomic mechanisms of cardiac-activity regulation. A functional load test with the administration of dopamine and serotonin precursors revealed unequal MA-synthesizing capabilities of the brain in animals with compensated and decompensated HF. Reduced capacity of the MA-ergic systems during decompensated HF may lead to overwork of the central mechanisms of regulation and the gradual depletion and disruption of compensatory mechanisms, which aggravates the progression of heart failure.",M.

Feature-reduction and semi-simulated data in functional connectivity-based cortical parcellation,/article/10.1007/s12264-013-1339-6,"Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has been used to parcellate the brain into functionally distinct regions based on the information available in functional connectivity maps. However, brain voxels are not independent units and adjacent voxels are always highly correlated, so functional connectivity maps contain redundant information, which not only impairs the computational efficiency during clustering, but also reduces the accuracy of clustering results. The aim of this study was to propose feature-reduction approaches to reduce the redundancy and to develop semi-simulated data with defined ground truth to evaluate these approaches. We proposed a feature-reduction approach based on the Affinity Propagation Algorithm (APA) and compared it with the classic featurereduction approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We tested the two approaches to the parcellation of both semi-simulated and real seed regions using the K-means algorithm and designed two experiments to evaluate their noiseresistance. We found that all functional connectivity maps (with/without feature reduction) provided correct information for the parcellation of the semisimulated seed region and the computational efficiency was greatly improved by both featurereduction approaches. Meanwhile, the APA-based feature-reduction approach outperformed the PCAbased approach in noise-resistance. The results suggested that functional connectivity maps can provide correct information for cortical parcellation, and feature-reduction does not significantly change the information. Considering the improvement in computational efficiency and the noise-resistance, feature-reduction of functional connectivity maps before cortical parcellation is both feasible and necessary.","Xiaoguang Tian, Cirong Liu, ...

Common Atlas Format and 3D Brain Atlas Reconstructor: Infrastructure for Constructing 3D Brain Atlases,/article/10.1007/s12021-011-9138-6,"One of the challenges of modern neuroscience is integrating voluminous data of diferent modalities derived from a variety of specimens. This task requires a common spatial framework that can be provided by brain atlases. The first atlases were limited to two-dimentional presentation of structural data. Recently, attempts at creating 3D atlases have been made to offer navigation within non-standard anatomical planes and improve capability of localization of different types of data within the brain volume. The 3D atlases available so far have been created using frameworks which make it difficult for other researchers to replicate the results. To facilitate reproducible research and data sharing in the field we propose an SVG-based Common Atlas Format (CAF) to store 2D atlas delineations or other compatible data and 3D Brain Atlas Reconstructor (3dBAR), software dedicated to automated reconstruction of three-dimensional brain structures from 2D atlas data. The basic functionality is provided by (1) a set of parsers which translate various atlases from a number of formats into the CAF, and (2) a module generating 3D models from CAF datasets. The whole reconstruction process is reproducible and can easily be configured, tracked and reviewed, which facilitates fixing errors. Manual corrections can be made when automatic reconstruction is not sufficient. The software was designed to simplify interoperability with other neuroinformatics tools by using open file formats. The content can easily be exchanged at any stage of data processing. The framework allows for the addition of new public or proprietary content.","Piotr Majka, Ewa Kublik, ...

Network measures for information extraction in evolutionary algorithms,/article/10.1080/18756891.2013.823004,"Problem domain information extraction is a critical issue in many real-world optimization problems. Increasing the repertoire of techniques available in evolutionary algorithms with this purpose is fundamental for extending the applicability of these algorithms. In this paper we introduce a unifying information mining approach for evolutionary algorithms. Our proposal is based on a division of the stages where structural modelling of the variables interactions is applied. Particular topological characteristics induced from different stages of the modelling process are identified. Network theory is used to harvest problem structural information from the learned probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We show how different statistical measures, previously studied for networks from different domains, can be applied to mine the graphical component of PGMs. We provide evidence that the computed measures can be employed for studying problem difficulty, classifying different problem instances and predicting the algorithm behavior.","Roberto Santana, Rubén Armañanzas, ...

Models are constantly evolving however, to take account of new experimental findings and to address new research questions, both by the original modellers, and by other researchers who help provide quality control/debugging of original scripts and convert the model (components) for use in other simulators.

Interactions between the neuromodulatory systems and the amygdala: exploratory survey using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas,/article/10.1007/s00429-012-0473-7,"Neuromodulatory systems originate in nuclei localized in the subcortical region of the brain and control fundamental behaviors by interacting with many areas of the central nervous system. An exploratory survey of the cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic receptor expression energy in the amygdala, and in the neuromodulatory areas themselves was undertaken using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. The amygdala was chosen because of its importance in cognitive behavior and its bidirectional interaction with the neuromodulatory systems. The gene expression data of 38 neuromodulatory receptor subtypes were examined across 13 brain regions. The substantia innominata of the basal forebrain and regions of the amygdala had the highest amount of receptor expression energy for all four neuromodulatory systems examined. The ventral tegmental area also displayed high receptor expression of all four neuromodulators. In contrast, the locus coeruleus displayed low receptor expression energy overall. In general, cholinergic receptor expression was an order of magnitude greater than other neuromodulatory receptors. Since the nuclei of these neuromodulatory systems are thought to be the source of specific neurotransmitters, the projections from these nuclei to target regions may be inferred by receptor expression energy. The comprehensive analysis revealed many connectivity relations and receptor localization that had not been previously reported. The methodology presented here may be applied to other neural systems with similar characteristics, and to other animal models as these brain atlases become available.","Andrew Zaldivar, Jeffrey L.

Tracking the Source of Quantitative Knowledge in Neuroscience: A Neuroinformatics Role for Computational Models,/article/10.1007/s12021-011-9100-7,"A significant benefit of computational models is that they mandate the explicit and quantitative account of all variables involved in the scientific problem being investigated.Footnote 1 When a simulation is launched, the software program reads a series of parameter values that are assigned by the investigator. In compartmental models of neuronal electrophysiology, these parameters might correspond to membrane capacitances, axial resistances, synaptic conductances, reversal potentials, etc. for various parts of the neuron. In a model of neural network dynamics, parameters might include the interconnectivity, activation threshold, and input/output relations of the nodes or units. Other models will require biophysical parameters (and corresponding values) appropriate for the scale, domain, and scope of investigation. A developmental model of dendritic growth might use filopodia elongation and retraction rates, whereas a second messenger signaling model could instead use kinetic constants for each enzymatic step of the metabotropic cascade.","John L.

The Mental Illness and Neuroscience Discovery Institute, now the Mind Research Network (MRN, http://www.mrn.org/), comprised of investigators at the University of New Mexico, the University of Minnesota, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Iowa, conducted a cross-sectional study to identify quantitative neuroimaging biomarkers of schizophrenia. Data acquisition across multiple sites permitted the integration and cross-validation of clinical, cognitive, morphometric, and functional neuroimaging results gathered from unique samples of schizophrenia patients and controls using a common protocol across sites. Particular effort was made to recruit patients early in the course of their illness, at the onset of their symptoms. There is a relatively even sampling of illness duration in chronic patients. This data repository will be useful to 1) scientists who can study schizophrenia by further analysis of this cohort and/or by pooling with other data; 2) computer scientists and software algorithm developers for testing and validating novel registration, segmentation, and other analysis software; and 3) educators in the fields of neuroimaging, medical image analysis and medical imaging informatics who need exemplar data sets for courses and workshops.

Magnetic-field variations and solar flare activity,/article/10.1134/S1063772912100010,"Solar filtergrams obtained at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory at the center and wings of the Hα line are used to study variations in filaments, in particular, in arch filament systems (AFSs). These are considered as an indicator of emerging new magnetic flux, providing information about the spatial locations of magnetic-field elements. Magnetic-field maps for the active region NOAA 10030 are analyzed as an example. A method developed earlier for detecting elements of emerging flux using SOHO/MDI magnetograms indicates a close link between the increase in flare activity in theNOAA 10030 group during July 14–18, 2002 and variations in the topological disconnectedness of the magnetograms. Moreover, variations in the flare activity one day before a flare event are correlated with variations in the topological complexity of the field (the Euler characteristic) in regions with high field strengths (more than 700 G). Analysis of multi-wavelength polarization observations on the RATAN-600 radio telescope during July 13–17, 2002 indicate dominance of the radio emission above the central spot associated with the increase in flare activity. In addition to the flare site near the large spot in the group, numerous weak flares developed along an extended local neutral line, far from the central line of the large-scale field. The statistical characteristics of the magnetic-field maps analyzed were determined, and show flare activity of both types, i.e., localized in spot penumbras and above the neutral line of the field.","I.

Fine-Granularity Functional Interaction Signatures for Characterization of Brain Conditions,/article/10.1007/s12021-013-9177-2,"In the human brain, functional activity occurs at multiple spatial scales. Current studies on functional brain networks and their alterations in brain diseases via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are generally either at local scale (regionally confined analysis and inter-regional functional connectivity analysis) or at global scale (graph theoretic analysis). In contrast, inferring functional interaction at fine-granularity sub-network scale has not been adequately explored yet. Here our hypothesis is that functional interaction measured at fine-granularity sub-network scale can provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of neurological and psychological conditions, thus offering complementary information for healthy and diseased population classification. In this paper, we derived fine-granularity functional interaction (FGFI) signatures in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Schizophrenia by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and rs-fMRI, and used patient-control classification experiments to evaluate the distinctiveness of the derived FGFI features. Our experimental results have shown that the FGFI features alone can achieve comparable classification performance compared with the commonly used inter-regional connectivity features. However, the classification performance can be substantially improved when FGFI features and inter-regional connectivity features are integrated, suggesting the complementary information achieved from the FGFI signatures.","Xintao Hu, Dajiang Zhu, ...

An application domain is defined by the mathematical model of an asynchronous multicomponent system, and the time-dependent state of the model is described by a set of hypotheses. The states of individual components are recorded by sensors, the signals of which are used to verify hypotheses. The hypothesis selection reliability depends on the validity of information contained in signals coming from sensors. The proposed methods enable the identification of repetitive and contradictory signals and clusterization of signals belonging to independent and simultaneous informational processes. The features of the proposed approach are the for-mal model of application-domain knowledge and methods based on abstract mathematical objects, which can be employed to solve monitoring problems in different application domains.",V.

Learning gait of quadruped robot without prior knowledge of the environment,/article/10.3901/CJME.2012.05.1068,"Walking is the basic skill of a legged robot, and one of the promising ways to improve the walking performance and its adaptation to environment changes is to let the robot learn its walking by itself. Currently, most of the walking learning methods are based on robot vision system or some external sensing equipment to estimate the walking performance of certain walking parameters, and therefore are usually only applicable under laboratory condition, where environment can be pre-defined. Inspired by the rhythmic swing movement during walking of legged animals and the behavior of their adjusting their walking gait on different walking surfaces, a concept of walking rhythmic pattern(WRP) is proposed to evaluate the walking specialty of legged robot, which is just based on the walking dynamics of the robot. Based on the onboard acceleration sensor data, a method to calculate WRP using power spectrum in frequency domain and diverse smooth filters is also presented. Since the evaluation of WRP is only based on the walking dynamics data of the robot's body, the proposed method doesn't require prior knowledge of environment and thus can be applied in unknown environment. A gait learning approach of legged robots based on WRP and evolution algorithm(EA) is introduced. By using the proposed approach, a quadruped robot can learn its locomotion by its onboard sensing in an unknown environment, where the robot has no prior knowledge about this place. The experimental result proves proportional relationship exits between WRP match score and walking performance of legged robot, which can be used to evaluate the walking performance in walking optimization under unknown environment.","Tao Xu, Qijun Chen",2012-09-20
Progress in defining heterogeneity and modeling periglomerular cells in the olfactory bulb,/article/10.1007/s11427-012-4346-3,"In recent years the evolution of olfactory bulb periglomerular cells, as well as the function of periglomerular cells in olfactory encoding, has attracted increasing attention. Studies of neural information encoding based on the analysis of simulation and modeling have given rise to electrophysiological models of periglomerular cells, which have an important role in the understanding of the biology of these cells. In this review we provide a brief introduction to the anatomy of the olfactory system and the cell types in the olfactory bulb. We elaborate on the latest progress in the study of the heterogeneity of periglomerular cells based on different classification criteria, such as molecular markers, structure, ion channels and action potentials. Then, we discuss the several existing electrophysiological models of periglomerular cells, and we highlight the problems and defects of these models.

Towards a Computational Model of Actor-Based Language Comprehension,/article/10.1007/s12021-013-9198-x,"Neurophysiological data from a range of typologically diverse languages provide evidence for a cross-linguistically valid, actor-based strategy of understanding sentence-level meaning. This strategy seeks to identify the participant primarily responsible for the state of affairs (the actor) as quickly and unambiguously as possible, thus resulting in competition for the actor role when there are multiple candidates. Due to its applicability across languages with vastly different characteristics, we have proposed that the actor strategy may derive from more basic cognitive or neurobiological organizational principles, though it is also shaped by distributional properties of the linguistic input (e.g. the morphosyntactic coding strategies for actors in a given language). Here, we describe an initial computational model of the actor strategy and how it interacts with language-specific properties. Specifically, we contrast two distance metrics derived from the output of the computational model (one weighted and one unweighted) as potential measures of the degree of competition for actorhood by testing how well they predict modulations of electrophysiological activity engendered by language processing. To this end, we present an EEG study on word order processing in German and use linear mixed-effects models to assess the effect of the various distance metrics. Our results show that a weighted metric, which takes into account the weighting of an actor-identifying feature in the language under consideration outperforms an unweighted distance measure. We conclude that actor competition effects cannot be reduced to feature overlap between multiple sentence participants and thereby to the notion of similarity-based interference, which is prominent in current memory-based models of language processing. Finally, we argue that, in addition to illuminating the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of actor competition, the present model can form the basis for a more comprehensive, neurobiologically plausible computational model of constructing sentence-level meaning.","Phillip M.

Detecting the knowledge structure of bioinformatics by mining full-text collections,/article/10.1007/s11192-012-0900-9,"Bioinformatics is a fast-growing, diverse research field that has recently gained much public attention. Even though there are several attempts to understand the field of bioinformatics by bibliometric analysis, the proposed approach in this paper is the first attempt at applying text mining techniques to a large set of full-text articles to detect the knowledge structure of the field. To this end, we use PubMed Central full-text articles for bibliometric analysis instead of relying on citation data provided in Web of Science. In particular, we develop text mining routines to build a custom-made citation database as a result of mining full-text. We present several interesting findings in this study. First, the majority of the papers published in the field of bioinformatics are not cited by others (63 % of papers received less than two citations). Second, there is a linear, consistent increase in the number of publications. Particularly year 2003 is the turning point in terms of publication growth. Third, most researches of bioinformatics are driven by USA-based institutes followed by European institutes. Fourth, the results of topic modeling and word co-occurrence analysis reveal that major topics focus more on biological aspects than on computational aspects of bioinformatics. However, the top 10 ranked articles identified by PageRank are more related to computational aspects. Fifth, visualization of author co-citation analysis indicates that researchers in molecular biology or genomics play a key role in connecting sub-disciplines of bioinformatics.","Min Song, Su Yeon Kim",2012-11-10

Resting State fMRI-guided Fiber Clustering: Methods and Applications,/article/10.1007/s12021-012-9169-7,"Clustering streamline fibers derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data into functionally meaningful bundles with group-wise correspondences across individuals and populations has been a fundamental step for tract-based analysis of white matter integrity and brain connectivity modeling. Many approaches of fiber clustering reported in the literature so far used geometric and/or anatomic information derived from structural MRI and/or DTI data only. In this paper, we take a novel, alternative multimodal approach of combining resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) and DTI data, and propose to use functional coherence as the criterion to guide the clustering of fibers derived from DTI tractography. Specifically, the functional coherence between two streamline fibers is defined as their rsfMRI time series’ correlations, and the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is used to cluster DTI-derived streamline fibers into bundles. Currently, we use the corpus callosum (CC) fibers, which are the largest fiber bundle in the brain, as a test-bed for methodology development and validation. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed rsfMRI-guided fiber clustering method can achieve functionally homogeneous bundles that are reasonably consistent across individuals and populations, suggesting the close relationship between structural connectivity and brain function. The clustered fiber bundles were evaluated and validated via the benchmark data provided by task-based fMRI, via reproducibility studies, and via comparison with other methods. Finally, we have applied the proposed framework on a multimodal rsfMRI/DTI dataset of schizophrenia (SZ) and reproducible results were obtained.","Bao Ge, Lei Guo, ... Tianming Liu",2012-10-12
Neuroinformatics in Clinical and Translational Medicine—Novel Approaches,/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9087-5,"This special edition of Neuroinformatics was conceived as a way to highlight the new and rapidly developing field of clinical neuroinformatics. The application of neuroinformatics to the clinical domain encompasses support for clinical trials that use neuroimaging biomarkers as primary or secondary outcome measures, as well as the assembly of patient data into databases, development of tools to analyze these data and their application to addressing clinical translational research and treatment questions. The premise of clinical neuroinformatics is that valuable information can be mined from the vast volume of clinical research and treatment information which is now collected, including diagnostic studies and neuroimaging studies performed for a wide variety of disorders and purposes, if that data could be appropriately transmitted to the scientific community. Since much patient-oriented data are collected in a systematic and standard manner, large databases with de-identification may be an appropriate analytical approach. The strong federal impetus to advance medical informatics is galvanizing efforts to assemble patient-oriented data into such databases, helping to develop solutions to address the critical need for the protection of patient privacy. Rigorous procedures for proper de-identification must be used, since most patient data is sensitive and when initially acquired, completely linked to the patient’s identify; alternatively, robust methods to protect against inadvertent disclosure must be determined. Many areas of research in neuroinformatics critical to advancement of this field ranging from development of robust solutions for multisite data management to calibration of cross-site image acquisition are highlighted.","Randy L.

Extracting Intrinsic Functional Networks with Feature-Based Group Independent Component Analysis,/article/10.1007/s11336-012-9291-3,"There is increasing use of functional imaging data to understand the macro-connectome of the human brain. Of particular interest is the structure and function of intrinsic networks (regions exhibiting temporally coherent activity both at rest and while a task is being performed), which account for a significant portion of the variance in functional MRI data. While networks are typically estimated based on the temporal similarity between regions (based on temporal correlation, clustering methods, or independent component analysis [ICA]), some recent work has suggested that these intrinsic networks can be extracted from the inter-subject covariation among highly distilled features, such as amplitude maps reflecting regions modulated by a task or even coordinates extracted from large meta analytic studies. In this paper our goal was to explicitly compare the networks obtained from a first-level ICA (ICA on the spatio-temporal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data) to those from a second-level ICA (i.e., ICA on computed features rather than on the first-level fMRI data). Convergent results from simulations, task-fMRI data, and rest-fMRI data show that the second-level analysis is slightly noisier than the first-level analysis but yields strikingly similar patterns of intrinsic networks (spatial correlations as high as 0.85 for task data and 0.65 for rest data, well above the empirical null) and also preserves the relationship of these networks with other variables such as age (for example, default mode network regions tended to show decreased low frequency power for first-level analyses and decreased loading parameters for second-level analyses). In addition, the best-estimated second-level results are those which are the most strongly reflected in the input feature. In summary, the use of feature-based ICA appears to be a valid tool for extracting intrinsic networks. We believe it will become a useful and important approach in the study of the macro-connectome, particularly in the context of data fusion.","Vince D. Calhoun, Elena Allen",2012-10-02
Meta-Analysis of Functional Roles of DICCCOLs,/article/10.1007/s12021-012-9165-y,"DICCCOL (Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks) is a recently published system composed of 358 cortical landmarks that possess consistent correspondences across individuals and populations. Meanwhile, each DICCCOL landmark is localized in an individual brain’s unique morphological profile, and therefore the DICCCOL system offers a universal and individualized brain reference and localization framework. However, in current 358 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived DICCCOLs, only 95 of them have been functionally annotated via task-based or resting-state fMRI datasets and the functional roles of other DICCCOLs are unknown yet. This work aims to take the advantage of existing literature fMRI studies (1110 publications) reported and aggregated in the BrainMap database to examine the possible functional roles of 358 DICCCOLs via meta-analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that a majority of 358 DICCCOLs can be functionally annotated by the BrainMap database, and many DICCCOLs have rich and diverse functional roles in multiple behavior domains. This study provides novel insights into the functional regularity and diversity of 358 DICCCOLs, and offers a starting point for future elucidation of fine-grained functional roles of cortical landmarks.","Yixuan Yuan, Xi Jiang, ...

Study of sleep in a walrus,/article/10.1134/S0012496612030143,"Several behavioral and physiological adaptations have been developed in evolution of Pinnipeds allowing them to sleep both on land and in water. To date sleep has been examined in detail in eared and true seals (the families of Otariidae and Phocidae). The aim of this study was to examine sleep in another semiaquatic mammal — the walrus, which is the only extant representative of the family Odobenidae. Slow wave and paradoxical sleep (SWS and PS) in the examined walrus (2 year old female, weight 130 kg) averaged 19.4 ± 2.0 and 6.9 ± 1.1% of 24-h when on land, and 20.5 ± 0.8% of 24-h and 1.1 ± 0.6% when in water, respectively. The average duration of PS episode was 6.4 ± 0.6 min (maximum 23 min) when on land and 1.8 ± 0.1 min (maximum 3.3 min) when in water. In water, sleep occurred predominantly while the walrus submerged and lay on the bottom of the pool (89% of total sleep time). The walrus usually woke up while emerging to the surface for breathing. Most often EEG slow waves developed synchronously in both cortical hemispheres (90% of SWS time when on land and 97% when in water). Short episodes of interhemispheric EEG asymmetry usually coincided with brief opening of one eye. The pattern of sleep in the walrus was similar to the pattern of sleep in the Otariidae seals while on land (predominantly bilateral SWS, accompanied by regular breathing) and to the pattern of sleep in the Phocidae while in water (sleep during apneas both in depth and at the surface, interrupted by brief arousal when emerging for breathing).","O.

Self-organization of reflexive behavior from spontaneous motor activity,/article/10.1007/s00422-012-0521-7,"In mammals, the development of reflexes is often regarded as an innate process. However, recent findings show that fetuses are endowed with favorable conditions for ontogenetic development. In this article, we hypothesize that the circuitry of at least some mammalian reflexes can be self-organized from the sensory and motor interactions brought forth in a musculoskeletal system. We focus mainly on three reflexes: the myotatic reflex, the reciprocal inhibition reflex, and the reverse myotatic reflex. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a set of experiments on a simulated musculoskeletal system using pairs of agonist and antagonist muscles. The reflex connectivity is obtained by producing spontaneous motor activity in each muscle and by correlating the resulting sensor and motor signals. Our results show that, under biologically plausible conditions, the reflex circuitry thus obtained is consistent with that identified in relation to the analogous mammalian reflexes. In addition, they show that the reflex connectivity obtained depends on the morphology of the musculoskeletal system as well as on the environment that it is embedded in.","Hugo Gravato Marques, Farhan Imtiaz, ...

Dependence of Transformation of Intrinsic Rhythmic Impulse Activity of Neurons on Spatio-Temporal Organization of Synaptic Actions on Dendrites: A Simulation Study,/article/10.1007/s11062-012-9246-4,"The aim of the study to elucidate the biophysical mechanisms able to determine specific transformations of the patterns of output signals of neurons (neuronal impulse codes) depending on the spatio-temporal organization of synaptic actions coming to the dendrites. We studied mathematical models of the neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons built according to the results of computer reconstruction of their dendritic arborizations and experimental data on the voltage-dependent conductivities of their dendritic membrane. This work is a continuation of our previous studies that showed the existence of certain relations between the complexity of neural impulse codes, on the one hand, and the complexity, size, metrical asymmetry of branching, and nonlinear membrane properties of the dendrites, on the other hand. This relation determines synchronous (with some phase shifts) or asynchronous transitions of asymmetrical dendritic subtrees between high and low depolarization states during the generation of output impulse patterns in response to distributed tonic activation of dendritic inputs. In this work we demonstrate the first time that the appearance and pattern of transformations of complex periodical impulse trains at the neuron’s output associated with receiving a short series of presynaptic action potentials are determined not only by the time of arrival of such a series, but also by their spatial addressing to asymmetric dendritic subtrees; the latter, in this case, may be in the same (synchronous transitions) or different (asynchronous transitions) electrical states. Biophysically, this phenomenon is based on a significant excess of the driving potential for a synaptic excitatory current in low-depolarization regions, as compared with that in high-depolarization dendritic regions receiving phasic synaptic stimuli. These findings open a novel aspect of the functioning of neurons and neuronal networks.","I. B. Kulagina, S. M. Korogod",2012-02-11
Q&A: What is the Open Connectome Project?,/article/10.1186/2042-1001-1-16,"Although it has been over a century since neuroscientists first conjectured that networks of neurons comprise the brain, technology has limited high-throughput investigations of neural circuitry until very recently. In the last couple of decades, several experimental paradigms have arisen that are poised to finally begin studying neuroanatomy in a high-throughput fashion. In 2005, the term connectome was coined independently by Patric Hagmann [1] and Olaf Sporns [2], to describe the complete set of neural connections in a brain. Interestingly, both usages seemed to be referring to using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study human brain networks. Shortly thereafter, Narayanan ""Bobby"" Kasthuri and Jeff Lichtman published an article [3, 4] suggesting that ""connectome"" should refer to connections between neurons, which one can infer using Electron Microscopy (EM) and fluorescence microscopy (e.g., brainbow animals [5]) ""Projectome"", they suggested, is more appropriate for MRI based studies.

Using Evolutionary Algorithms for Fitting High-Dimensional Models to Neuronal Data,/article/10.1007/s12021-012-9140-7,"In the study of neurosciences, and of complex biological systems in general, there is frequently a need to fit mathematical models with large numbers of parameters to highly complex datasets. Here we consider algorithms of two different classes, gradient following (GF) methods and evolutionary algorithms (EA) and examine their performance in fitting a 9-parameter model of a filter-based visual neuron to real data recorded from a sample of 107 neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1). Although the GF method converged very rapidly on a solution, it was highly susceptible to the effects of local minima in the error surface and produced relatively poor fits unless the initial estimates of the parameters were already very good. Conversely, although the EA required many more iterations of evaluating the model neuron’s response to a series of stimuli, it ultimately found better solutions in nearly all cases and its performance was independent of the starting parameters of the model. Thus, although the fitting process was lengthy in terms of processing time, the relative lack of human intervention in the evolutionary algorithm, and its ability ultimately to generate model fits that could be trusted as being close to optimal, made it far superior in this particular application than the gradient following methods. This is likely to be the case in many further complex systems, as are often found in neuroscience.","Carl-Magnus Svensson, Stephen Coombes, Jonathan Westley Peirce",2012-01-20

Therefore, it is essential to analyze the underlying transcriptome during development to understand the genetic blueprint of the cerebellar cortical circuit. In this review, we introduce the profiling of large numbers of spatiotemporal gene expression data obtained by developmental time-series microarray analyses and in situ hybridization cellular mRNA mapping, and the creation of a neuroinformatics database called the Cerebellar Development Transcriptome Database. Using this database, we have identified thousands of genes that are classified into various functional categories and are expressed coincidently with related cellular developmental stages. We have also suggested the molecular mechanisms of cerebellar development by functional characterization of several identified genes (Cupidin, p130Cas, very-KIND, CAPS2) responsible for distinct cellular events of developing cerebellar granule cells. Taken together, the gene expression profiling during the cerebellar development demonstrates that the development of cerebellar cortical circuit is attributed to the complex but orchestrated transcriptome.","Teiichi Furuichi, Yoko Shiraishi-Yamaguchi, ...

NIF and NeuroLex,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2011.6238.1,"In the digital age one can find data and teaching materials on the web, however data and materials of a high quality are not always ranked very high on commercial search engines that look at the number of other sites that link to a page rather than the quality of the information. Additionally, many such materials are maintained within databases that are inaccessible to search technology. To solve these problems, the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF: http://www.neuinfo.org) was created to aid the neuroscience community to discover useful digital resources, such as academic databases, and it has also developed a large digital catalog of resources that are related to neuroscience.NIF has developed a “resource ontology”, and synchronized to a large extent the effort with the BRO (biomedical resource ontology) and assigned all 4000+ digital resources within the catalog to one or more of these ontological categories, making it possible to discover for example: all atlases through the NIF catalog. The resource categories are: Data, Funding, Job, Material, People, Services, Software, and Training. Most of these comprise sub-categorizations, definitions and synonyms and they can be viewed in the Neurolex found at http://neurolex.org/wiki/Resource_Type_Hierarchy. Each “resource descriptor” has been coded in OWL format files and has a unique identifier as well as synonyms and subclasses to help search systems locate data.Cataloging efforts of digital resources are tricky because unlike publications they can change at any time, including major shifts of data and structure, therefore the curation effort must be reasonably scoped and relatively nimble. NIF has developed some self reporting tools in the DISCO suite, accessible from http://disco.neuinfo.org/webportal/discoDashboardShow.do, to create just such a nimble resource identification system such that when a resource changes content or data structure significantly, the resource provider (such as the webmaster or database engineer) can change a small xml file sitting on their home page that will alert the NIF system and any other automated agent that the resource has changed. This tool in addition to the human curation effort results in a catalog that is reasonably representative of the state of biomedical resources.NIF maintains a list of current policies, issues and solicits input from community members at https://confluence.crbs.ucsd.edu/display/NIF/NIF+Resources+and+Curation+Policies.",Anita Bandrowski,2011-08-15

Results from confirmatory factory analysis indicated that a one-factor solution fit the MAAS data satisfactorily. Reliability coefficients, including Cronbach's alpha, Guttman split-half, item–total correlations, and test–retest, were also satisfactory. Addressing validity, the MAAS was negatively correlated with PANAS negative affect and positively associated with PANAS positive affect as well as with the quality of life indexed by the WHOQOL-BREF.

Evidence from brain imaging studies shows that spatiotemporal patterns of activations across different brain tissues correlate with brain function (and hence with an organism’s behavior). To support a diversity of global functions, gross connections between brain tissues, while structurally static, must undergo modulation. The strength of this modulation can define functional boundaries and interfaces between brain tissues: wherever functional relationships between brain regions are highly modulated, tissue boundaries occur.",James Kozloski,2011-05-03
Multiple dynamical time-scales in networks with hierarchically nested modular organization,/article/10.1007/s12043-011-0196-y,"Many natural and engineered complex networks have intricate mesoscopic organization, e.g., the clustering of the constituent nodes into several communities or modules. Often, such modularity is manifested at several different hierarchical levels, where the clusters defined at one level appear as elementary entities at the next higher level. Using a simple model of a hierarchical modular network, we show that such a topological structure gives rise to characteristic time-scale separation between dynamics occurring at different levels of the hierarchy. This generalizes our earlier result for simple modular networks, where fast intramodular and slow intermodular processes were clearly distinguished. Investigating the process of synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network, we show the existence of as many distinct time-scales as there are hierarchical levels in the system. This suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic organization principle in natural systems, viz., in the dynamical separation of events occurring at different spatial scales.","SITABHRA SINHA, SWARUP PORIA",2011-11-03

Synchronisation effects on the behavioural performance and information dynamics of a simulated minimally cognitive robotic agent,/article/10.1007/s00422-012-0507-5,"Oscillatory activity is ubiquitous in nervous systems, with solid evidence that synchronisation mechanisms underpin cognitive processes. Nevertheless, its informational content and relationship with behaviour are still to be fully understood. In addition, cognitive systems cannot be properly appreciated without taking into account brain–body– environment interactions. In this paper, we developed a model based on the Kuramoto Model of coupled phase oscillators to explore the role of neural synchronisation in the performance of a simulated robotic agent in two different minimally cognitive tasks. We show that there is a statistically significant difference in performance and evolvability depending on the synchronisation regime of the network. In both tasks, a combination of information flow and dynamical analyses show that networks with a definite, but not too strong, propensity for synchronisation are more able to reconfigure, to organise themselves functionally and to adapt to different behavioural conditions. The results highlight the asymmetry of information flow and its behavioural correspondence. Importantly, it also shows that neural synchronisation dynamics, when suitably flexible and reconfigurable, can generate minimally cognitive embodied behaviour.","Renan C. Moioli, Patricia A.

Mechanistic mechanisms of competition and biodiversity,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2012.7105.1,"The nature of competition and biodiversity are open basic questions since Darwin. To investigate mechanisms of interspecific competition and their contribution in biodiversity as closely as possible we offer a white-box modelling method based on physically interpreted ecological axioms. These models are implemented as deterministic individual-based cellular automata and able to give a direct physico-mechanistic insight into studied phenomena. Competition of two trophically identical but fitness different species, competing for one limiting resource in one stable uniform habitat (which is closed for immigration, emigration, predation, herbivory and parasitism) has been investigated in conditions, which are the most unfavourable for their coexistence. The species are per capita identical in fecundity, ontogeny, regeneration features of microhabitats, and in habitat requirements. We have modelled following 8 mechanistic mechanisms of interspecific competition:1.	A case of the competitive exclusion when competing species differ only in fitness.2.	Coexistence based on periodic dominance changeovers as a consequence of environmental changes. Competing species differ only in fitness.3.	A strong violation of the competitive exclusion principle due to the lowered fecundity of both competitors. Competing species differ only in fitness.4.	Coexistence based on the competition–colonisation trade-off when greater fitness is compensated by r-strategy.5.	A competition–colonisation trade-off based on differences in ontogeny.6.	Competitive exclusion when recessive species drives out the dominant one having four times greater fecundity than the dominant one in stable environment (the greater fitness cannot compensate r-strategy).7.	An inverted competitive exclusion when recessive species drives out the dominant one by strategy of anticipatory deprivation of resources for competitor’s offsprings propagation. Recessive species drives out the dominant one in stable environment and both competing species have identical fecundity (tripod neighbourhood). Paradoxically, but the greater fitness cannot save the dominant species when the all other parameters of the species are equal.8.	Both competing species die because the regeneration of a limiting environmental resource takes too much time and they cannot propagate.The revealed mechanisms of competition can be useful not only in conservation biology, but also in economics and politics. Additionally, we speculate that the simplest way to maintain biodiversity is a controlled reduction of human fertility as the decrease in biodiversity occurs largely due to humankind overloading of biosphere resources.","Lev Kalmykov, Vyacheslav Kalmykov",2012-04-02

A human tutor can teach the robot which is in turn able to integrate newly learned skills into different movement sequences online.

Generalization to new tasks is obtained by decoupling the learned movements from the robot’s embodiment using a task space representation. It is chosen automatically from a commonly used task space pool. The movement descriptions are further decoupled from specific object instances by formulating them with respect to so-called linked objects. They act as references and can interactively be bound to real objects. When executing a learned task, a flexible kinematic description allows to change the robot’s body schema online and thereby apply the learned movement relative to different body parts or new objects. An efficient optimization scheme adapts movements to such situations performing online obstacle and self-collision avoidance. Finally, all described processes are combined within a comprehensive architecture. To demonstrate the generalization capabilities we show experiments where the robot performs a movement bimanually in different environments, although the task was demonstrated by the tutor only one-handed.","Manuel Mühlig, Michael Gienger, Jochen J.

Individual Functional ROI Optimization Via Maximization of Group-Wise Consistency of Structural and Functional Profiles,/article/10.1007/s12021-012-9142-5,"Studying connectivities among functional brain regions and the functional dynamics on brain networks has drawn increasing interest. A fundamental issue that affects functional connectivity and dynamics studies is how to determine the best possible functional brain regions or ROIs (regions of interest) for a group of individuals, since the connectivity measurements are heavily dependent on ROI locations. Essentially, identification of accurate, reliable and consistent corresponding ROIs is challenging due to the unclear boundaries between brain regions, variability across individuals, and nonlinearity of the ROIs. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a novel methodology to computationally optimize ROIs locations derived from task-based fMRI data for individuals so that the optimized ROIs are more consistent, reproducible and predictable across brains. Our computational strategy is to formulate the individual ROI location optimization as a group variance minimization problem, in which group-wise consistencies in functional/structural connectivity patterns and anatomic profiles are defined as optimization constraints. Our experimental results from multimodal fMRI and DTI data show that the optimized ROIs have significantly improved consistency in structural and functional profiles across individuals. These improved functional ROIs with better consistency could contribute to further study of functional interaction and dynamics in the human brain.","Kaiming Li, Lei Guo, ... Tianming Liu",2012-01-28

"Bright Field Neuronal Preparation Optimized for Automatic Computerized Reconstruction, a Case with Cerebellar Climbing Fibers",/article/10.1007/s12021-011-9099-9,"To make the best use of computerized automatic reconstruction it is crucial to supply optimized neuronal preparations for reconstruction. For bright field preparations a major technique for labeling a specific population of neurons is the injection of tracers, such as dextran conjugated with biotin (biotinylated dextran amine, BDA). BDA-labeled neurons and axons can then be visualized in brain sections using the diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction, which causes BDA to form a dark precipitate. It is important for such brain sections to be oriented in an appropriate direction so that labeled neurons and axons are localized within individual sections to the greatest extent possible, because automatic reconstruction can be applied only within single brain sections (thickness of 50–100 μm) at the moment. In this sense, cerebellar climbing fibers, which are organized within a flat longitudinal plane, are among the best suited neuronal elements for automatic reconstruction. For automatic reconstruction, it is also important to separate individual, labeled neurons (or axons) from each other by controlling the amount of tracer. By solving these points the histological preparation can be optimized for automatic computerized reconstruction.",Izumi Sugihara,2011-02-02

The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology: Design and Application,/article/10.1007/s12021-011-9126-x,"We present the basic structure of the Cognitive Paradigm Ontology (CogPO) for human behavioral experiments. While the experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience literature may refer to certain behavioral tasks by name (e.g., the Stroop paradigm or the Sternberg paradigm) or by function (a working memory task, a visual attention task), these paradigms can vary tremendously in the stimuli that are presented to the subject, the response expected from the subject, and the instructions given to the subject. Drawing from the taxonomy developed and used by the BrainMap project (www.brainmap.org) for almost two decades to describe key components of published functional imaging results, we have developed an ontology capable of representing certain characteristics of the cognitive paradigms used in the fMRI and PET literature. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology is being developed to be compliant with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), and to harmonize where possible with larger ontologies such as RadLex, NeuroLex, or the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI). The key components of CogPO include the representation of experimental conditions focused on the stimuli presented, the instructions given, and the responses requested. The use of alternate and even competitive terminologies can often impede scientific discoveries. Categorization of paradigms according to stimulus, response, and instruction has been shown to allow advanced data retrieval techniques by searching for similarities and contrasts across multiple paradigm levels. The goal of CogPO is to develop, evaluate, and distribute a domain ontology of cognitive paradigms for application and use in the functional neuroimaging community.","Jessica A. Turner, Angela R.

Strong violation of the competitive exclusion principle,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2011.6667.1,"Bacteria and plants are able to form population waves as a result of their consumer behaviour and propagation. A soliton-like interpenetration of colliding population waves was assumed but not proved earlier. Here we show how and why colliding population waves of trophically identical but fitness different species can interpenetrate through each other without delay. We have hypothesized and revealed here that the last mechanism provides a stable coexistence of two, three and four species, competing for the same limiting resource in the small homogeneous habitat under constant conditions and without any fitness trade-offs. We have explained the mystery of biodiversity mechanistically because (i) our models are bottom-up mechanistic, (ii) the revealed interpenetration mechanism provides strong violation of the competitive exclusion principle and (iii) we have shown that the increase in the number of competing species increases the number of cases of coexistence. Thus the principled assumptions of fitness neutrality (equivalence), competitive trade-offs and competitive niches are redundant for fundamental explanation of species richness.","Lev Kalmykov, Vyacheslav Kalmykov",2011-12-05
Hierarchical approach to forecasting recurrent solar wind streams,/article/10.1134/S0038094611060086,"The hierarchical approach to predicting quasi-stationary, high-speed solar wind (SW) streams is described. This approach integrates various types of data into a single forecasting system by means of an ensemble of experts. The input data included the daily values of the coronal hole areas, which were calculated from the ultraviolet images of the Sun, and the speed of the SW streams during the previous solar rotations. The coronal hole areas were calculated from the images taken by the SWAP instrument aboard the PROBA2 satellite in the spectral interval centered at a wavelength of 17.4 nm and by the AIA instrument aboard the SDO spacecraft in the interval of wavelengths centered at 19.3 and 17.1 nm. The forecast was based on the data for 2010, corresponding to the rising phase of the 24th solar cycle. On the first hierarchical level, a few simple model estimates were obtained for the speed of the SW streams from the input data of each type. On the second level of hierarchy, the final 3 day ahead forecast of the SW velocity was formulated on the basis of the obtained estimates. The proposed hierarchical approach improves the accuracy of forecasting the SW velocity. In addition, in such a method of prediction, the data gaps in the records of one instrument do not crucially affect the final result of forecasting of the system as a whole.","Yu. S. Shugay, I. S.

Like all papers submitted to the journal the manuscripts are thoroughly refereed by two or three independent reviewers for scientific quality and clarity of the exposition. Usually, however, the reviewers have to trust that the authors gave a fair description of the software. The situation is somewhat similar to the review of experimental papers, where the referees have to trust that the authors describe the experiments accurately and completely. In experimental science, it would be impractical to reproduce systematically the empirical claims. For computer software, in contrast, this limitation only reflects an old-fashioned approach, stemming from a time when it was difficult to distribute code or executables, and when programs were often very platform-dependent. In this era of sharing of resources and data (Kennedy 2004) and of web-based software distribution (Gardner et al. 2008; Luo et al. 2009) it has become fairly easy to make the software itself also accessible to reviewers, opening possibilities for deeper review of software related papers.

Spatio-temporal dependencies in functional connectivity in rodent cortical cultures,/article/10.2478/s13230-012-0002-7,"Models of functional connectivity in cortical cultures on multi-electrodes arrays may aid in understanding how cognitive pathways form and improve techniques that aim to interface with neuronal systems. To enable research on such models, this study uses both data- and model-driven approaches to determine what dependencies are present in and between functional connectivity networks derived from bursts of extracellularly recorded activity. Properties of excitation in bursts were analysed using correlative techniques to assess the degree of linear dependence and then two parallel techniques were used to assess functional connectivity. Three models presenting increasing levels of spatio-temporal dependency were used to capture the dynamics of individual functional connections and their consistencies were verified using surrogate data. By comparing network-wide properties between model generated networks and functional networks from data, complex interdependencies were revealed. This indicates the persistent co-activation of neuronal pathways in spontaneous bursts, as can be found in whole brain structures.","Matthew C. Spencer, Julia H. Downes, ... Slawomir J.

Orientation hypercolumns of the visual cortex: Ring model,/article/10.1134/S0006350911030250,"A hypercolumn of the visual cortex is a functional unit formed of neighboring columns whose neurons respond to a stimulus of particular orientation. The function of the hypercolumn is to amplify the orientation tuning of visually evoked responses. According to the conventional simple model of a hypercolumn, neuronal populations with different orientation preferences are distributed on a ring. Every population is described by a firing rate (FR) model. To determine the limitations of the FR-ring model, it was compared with a more detailed ring model, which takes into account the distribution of neurons of each population according to their voltage values. In the case of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, every neuronal population is described by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The mapping of parameters was obtained. The simulations revealed differences in the behavior of the two models. The FPE-based model reacts faster to a change in stimulus orientation. The FPE ring model gives a steady-state solution in the form of waves of activity traveling on the ring, whereas the FR ring model presents amplitude instability for the same parameter set. The FPE ring model reproduces the characteristic effects of the FR ring model: virtual rotation and symmetry breaking.","E. Yu. Smirnova, A. V. Chizhov",2011-06-01

An additional capability—successive selection of spatially separated fragments of a visual scene—has been achieved via further model extension. The fragment selection (under minor natural restrictions on mutual fragment locations) is based on in-phase internal synchronization of oscillator ensembles, corresponding to all the fragments, and distinct phase shifts between different ensembles.","E.

Sensory maps in the olfactory cortex defined by long-range viral tracing of single neurons,/article/10.1038/nature09945,"Sensory information may be represented in the brain by stereotyped mapping of axonal inputs or by patterning that varies between individuals. In olfaction, a stereotyped map is evident in the first sensory processing centre, the olfactory bulb (OB), where different odours elicit activity in unique combinatorial patterns of spatially invariant glomeruli1,2. Activation of each glomerulus is relayed to higher cortical processing centres by a set of ∼20–50 ‘homotypic’ mitral and tufted (MT) neurons3. In the cortex, target neurons integrate information from multiple glomeruli to detect distinct features of chemically diverse odours4,5,6. How this is accomplished remains unclear, perhaps because the cortical mapping of glomerular information by individual MT neurons has not been described. Here we use new viral tracing and three-dimensional brain reconstruction methods to compare the cortical projections of defined sets of MT neurons. We show that the gross-scale organization of the OB is preserved in the patterns of axonal projections to one processing centre yet reordered in another, suggesting that distinct coding strategies may operate in different targets. However, at the level of individual neurons neither glomerular order nor stereotypy is preserved in either region. Rather, homotypic MT neurons from the same glomerulus innervate broad regions that differ between individuals. Strikingly, even in the same animal, MT neurons exhibit extensive diversity in wiring; axons of homotypic MT pairs diverge from each other, emit primary branches at distinct locations and 70–90% of branches of homotypic and heterotypic pairs are non-overlapping. This pronounced reorganization of sensory maps in the cortex offers an anatomic substrate for expanded combinatorial integration of information from spatially distinct glomeruli and predicts an unanticipated role for diversification of otherwise similar output neurons.","Sulagna Ghosh, Stephen D.

Neuroanatomic changes and their association with cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment: a meta-analysis,/article/10.1007/s00429-011-0333-x,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an acquired syndrome characterised by cognitive decline not affecting activities of daily living. Using a quantitative meta-analytic approach, we aimed to identify consistent neuroanatomic correlates of MCI and how they are related to cognitive dysfunction. The meta-analysis enrols 22 studies, involving 917 MCI (848 amnestic MCI) patients and 809 healthy controls. Only studies investigating local changes in grey matter and reporting whole-brain results in stereotactic coordinates were included and analysed using the activation likelihood estimation approach. Probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps were used to compare the localization of the obtained significant effects to histological areas. A correlation between the probability of grey matter changes and cognitive performance of MCI patients was performed. In MCI patients, the meta-analysis revealed three significant clusters of convergent grey matter atrophy, which were mainly situated in the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus, extending to the left medial temporal pole and thalamus, as well as in the bilateral precuneus. A sub-analysis in only amnestic MCI revealed a similar pattern. A voxel-wise analysis revealed a correlation between grey matter reduction and cognitive decline in the right hippocampus and amygdala as well as in the left thalamus. This study provides convergent evidence of a distinct neuroanatomical pattern in MCI. The correlation analysis with cognitive-mnestic decline further highlights the impact of limbic structures and the linkage with data from a functional neuroimaging database provides additional insight into underlying functions. Although different pathologies are underlying MCI, the observed neuroanatomical pattern of structural changes may reflect the common clinical denominator of cognitive impairment.","Thomas Nickl-Jockschat, Alexandra Kleiman, ...

Structure-Dependent Electrical and Concentration Processes in the Dendrites of Pyramidal Neurons of Superficial Neocortical Layers: Model Study,/article/10.1007/s11062-011-9191-7,"On mathematical models of pyramidal neurons localized in the neocortical layers 2/3, whose reconstructed dendritic arborization possessed passive linear or active nonlinear membrane properties, we studied the effect of morphology of the dendrites on their passive electrical transfer characteristics and also on the formation of patterns of spike discharges at the output of the cell under conditions of tonic activation via uniformly distributed excitatory synapses along the dendrites. For this purpose, we calculated morphometric characteristics of the size, complexity, metric asymmetry, and function of effectiveness of somatopetal transmission of the current (with estimation of the sensitivity of this efficacy to changes in the uniform membrane conductance) for the reconstructed dendritic arborization in general and also for its apical and basal subtrees. Spatial maps of the membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration, which corresponded to certain temporal patterns of spike discharges generated by the neuron upon different intensities of synaptic activation, were superimposed on the 3D image and dendrograms of the neuron. These maps were considered “spatial autographs” of the above patterns. The main discharge pattern included periodic two-spike bursts (dublets) generated with relatively stable intraburst interspike intervals and interburst intervals decreasing with a rise in the intensity of activation. Under conditions of intense activation, the interburst intervals became close to the intraburst intervals, so the cell began to generate continuous trains of action potentials. Such a repertoire (consisting of two patterns of the activity, periodical dublets and continuous discharges) is considerably scantier than that described earlier in pyramidal neurons of the neocortical layer 5. Under analogous conditions of activation, we observed in the latter cells a variety of patterns of output discharges of different complexities, including stochastic ones. A relatively short length of the apical dendrite subtree of layer 2/3 neurons and, correspondingly, a smaller metric asymmetry (differences between the lengths of the apical and basal dendritic branches and paths), as compared with those in layer 5 pyramidal neurons, are morphological factors responsible for the predominance of periodic spike dublets. As a result, there were two combinations of different electrical states of the sites of dendritic arborization (“spatial autographs”). In the case of dublets, these were high depolarization of the apical dendrites vs. low depolarization of the basal dendrites and a reverse combination; only the latter (reverse) combination corresponded to the case of continuous discharges. The relative simplicity and uniformity of spike patterns in the cells, apparently, promotes the predominance of network interaction in the processes of formation of the activity of pyramidal neurons of layers 2/3 and, thereby, a higher efficiency of the processes of intracortical association.","I.

Classification of gliomas on the basis of gene expression has revealed six major subtypes and provided insights into the underlying biology of each subtype. Integration of genome-wide data from different technologies has been used to identify many potential protein targets in this disease, while increasing the reliability and biological interpretability of results. Mapping genomic changes onto both known and inferred cellular networks represents the next level of analysis, and has yielded proteins with key roles in tumorigenesis. Ultimately, the information gained from these approaches will be used to create customized therapeutic regimens for each patient based on the unique genomic signature of the individual tumor.

However, although these data are often difficult and expensive to produce, they are rarely shared and collaboratively exploited, and dissemination of new analysis methods may be restricted by issues of software and file compatibility. CARMEN (Code Analysis, Repository and Modeling for e-Neuroscience) aims to address these issues by creating an environment for handling time series data and for deploying analysis algorithms using distributed computing technology.","Colin D Ingram, Paul Watson, ...

Comparison of different neuron models to conductance-based post-stimulus time histograms obtained in cortical pyramidal cells using dynamic-clamp in vitro,/article/10.1007/s00422-011-0458-2,"A wide diversity of models have been proposed to account for the spiking response of central neurons, from the integrate-and-fire (IF) model and its quadratic and exponential variants, to multiple-variable models such as the Izhikevich (IZ) model and the well-known Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) type models. Such models can capture different aspects of the spiking response of neurons, but there is few objective comparison of their performance. In this article, we provide such a comparison in the context of well-defined stimulation protocols, including, for each cell, DC stimulation, and a series of excitatory conductance injections, arising in the presence of synaptic background activity. We use the dynamic-clamp technique to characterize the response of regular-spiking neurons from guinea-pig visual cortex by computing families of post-stimulus time histograms (PSTH), for different stimulus intensities, and for two different background activities (low- and high-conductance states). The data obtained are then used to fit different classes of models such as the IF, IZ, or HH types, which are constrained by the whole data set. This analysis shows that HH models are generally more accurate to fit the series of experimental PSTH, but their performance is almost equaled by much simpler models, such as the exponential or pulse-based IF models. Similar conclusions were also reached by performing partial fitting of the data, and examining the ability of different models to predict responses that were not used for the fitting. Although such results must be qualified by using more sophisticated stimulation protocols, they suggest that nonlinear IF models can capture surprisingly well the response of cortical regular-spiking neurons and appear as useful candidates for network simulations with conductance-based synaptic interactions.","Martin Pospischil, Zuzanna Piwkowska, ...

NeuroNames: An Ontology for the BrainInfo Portal to Neuroscience on the Web,/article/10.1007/s12021-011-9128-8,"BrainInfo (http://braininfo.org) is a growing portal to neuroscientific information on the Web. It is indexed by NeuroNames, an ontology designed to compensate for ambiguities in neuroanatomical nomenclature. The 20-year old ontology continues to evolve toward the ideal of recognizing all names of neuroanatomical entities and accommodating all structural concepts about which neuroscientists communicate, including multiple concepts of entities for which neuroanatomists have yet to determine the best or ‘true’ conceptualization. To make the definitions of structural concepts unambiguous and terminologically consistent we created a ‘default vocabulary’ of unique structure names selected from existing terminology. We selected standard names by criteria designed to maximize practicality for use in verbal communication as well as computerized knowledge management. The ontology of NeuroNames accommodates synonyms and homonyms of the standard terms in many languages. It defines complex structures as models composed of primary structures, which are defined in unambiguous operational terms. NeuroNames currently relates more than 16,000 names in eight languages to some 2,500 neuroanatomical concepts. The ontology is maintained in a relational database with three core tables: Names, Concepts and Models. BrainInfo uses NeuroNames to index information by structure, to interpret users’ queries and to clarify terminology on remote web pages. NeuroNames is a resource vocabulary of the NLM’s Unified Medical Language System (UMLS, 2011) and the basis for the brain regions component of NIFSTD (NeuroLex, 2011). The current version has been downloaded to hundreds of laboratories for indexing data and linking to BrainInfo, which attracts some 400 visitors/day, downloading 2,000 pages/day.","Douglas M.

In this system, coordinated locomotion is produced by concerted joint dynamics and interactions on different dynamical scales, which is therefore difficult to understand. Modeling using differential equations possesses, in general, the potential for the inclusion of biological detail, the suitability for simulation, and most importantly, parameter manipulation to make predictions about the system behavior. We will show in this review article how, in case of the stick insect walking system, continuous dynamical system models can help to understand coordinated locomotion.","Silvia Daun-Gruhn, Ansgar Büschges",2011-07-19

Synchronized changes to relative neuron populations in postnatal human neocortical development,/article/10.1007/s11571-010-9103-3,"Mammalian prenatal neocortical development is dominated by the synchronized formation of the laminae and migration of neurons. Postnatal development likewise contains “sensitive periods” during which functions such as ocular dominance emerge. Here we introduce a novel neuroinformatics approach to identify and study these periods of active development. Although many aspects of the approach can be used in other studies, some specific techniques were chosen because of a legacy dataset of human histological data (Conel in The postnatal development of the human cerebral cortex, vol 1–8. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1939–1967). Our method calculates normalized change vectors from the raw histological data, and then employs k-means cluster analysis of the change vectors to explore the population dynamics of neurons from 37 neocortical areas across eight postnatal developmental stages from birth to 72 months in 54 subjects. We show that the cortical “address” (Brodmann area/sub-area and layer) provides the necessary resolution to segregate neuron population changes into seven correlated “k-clusters” in k-means cluster analysis. The members in each k-cluster share a single change interval where the relative share of the cortex by the members undergoes its maximum change. The maximum change occurs in a different change interval for each k-cluster. Each k-cluster has at least one totally connected maximal “clique” which appears to correspond to cortical function.","David L. Cooper, James E. Gentle, ... James L. Olds",2010-02-03

EEG dynamics reflects the partial and holistic effects in mental imagery generation,/article/10.1631/jzus.B1000005,"Mental imagery generation is essential in the retrieval and storage of knowledge. Previous studies have indicated that the holistic properties of mental imagery generation can be evaluated more easily than the partial properties. However, the relationship between partial and holistic mental imagery generations has not been clearly demonstrated. To address this issue, we designed a task to investigate the changes in the spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during partial or holistic imagery generation. EEG signals were obtained from 18 healthy subjects, and a statistical measure of spectral dynamics between two EEG signals in per frequency band was performed. Additionally, a bicoherence spectrum analysis was used to detect the phase coupling within these two imagery conditions. Our results indicated that EEG of the partial imagery appeared earlier and stronger than that of the holistic imagery in the theta (5–8 Hz) range in a time window around 220 to 300 ms after cue onset, and a slight decrease in the alpha (8–12 Hz) band was observed at around 270 ms. The scalp topography of these changes in the theta and alpha bands distributed overall significantly in the frontal and central-temporal areas. The significant phase coupling within two conditions was remarkable at high frequency. From these results, we infer that there are complex relations between partial and holistic imageries. The generation of partial mental imagery is not a subprocess of holistic imagery, but it is relevant to holistic imagery and requires correct modification from the holistic information.","Jian Li, Yi-yuan Tang, ...

Wearable sensors for 3D upper limb motion modeling and ubiquitous estimation,/article/10.1007/s11768-011-0234-9,"Human motion capture technologies are widely used in interactive game and learning, animation, film special effects, health care, and navigation. Because of the agility, upper limb motion estimation is the most difficult problem in human motion capture. Traditional methods always assume that the movements of upper arm and forearm are independent and then estimate their movements separately; therefore, the estimated motion are always with serious distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel ubiquitous upper limb motion estimation method using wearable microsensors, which concentrates on modeling the relationship of the movements between upper arm and forearm. Exploration of the skeleton structure as a link structure with 5 degrees of freedom is firstly proposed to model human upper limb motion. After that, parameters are defined according to Denavit-Hartenberg convention, forward kinematic equations of upper limb are derived, and an unscented Kalman filter is invoked to estimate the defined parameters. The experimental results have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed upper limb motion capture and analysis algorithm.","Zhiqiang Zhang, Wai Choong Wong, Jiankang Wu",2011-02-01
ttime: an R Package for Translating the Timing of Brain Development Across Mammalian Species,/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9081-y,"Understanding relationships between the sequence and timing of brain developmental events across a given set of mammalian species can provide information about both neural development and evolution. Yet neurodevelopmental event timing data available from the published literature are incomplete, particularly for humans. Experimental documentation of unknown event timings requires considerable effort that can be expensive, time consuming, and for humans, often impossible. Application of suitable statistical models for translating neurodevelopmental event timings across mammalian species is essential. The present study implements an established statistical model and related functions as an open-source R package (ttime, translating time). The model incorporated into ttime allows predictions of unknown neurodevelopmental timings and explorations of phylogenetic relationships. The open-source package will enable transparency and reproducibility while minimizing redundancy. Sustainability and widespread dissemination will be guaranteed by the active CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) community. The package updates the web-service (Clancy et al. 2007b) www.translatingtime.net by permitting predictions based on curated event timing databases which may include species not yet incorporated in the current model. The R package can be integrated into complex workflows that use the event predictions in their analyses.

Apellicon: a web-based tool for constructing and curating Textpresso databases.,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2010.4927.1,"As more research literature in the biological sciences is made available in electronic format, text mining systems are increasingly being used to improve the ability of investigators to retrieve relevant information. Through the use of advanced indexing techniques that utilize biological ontologies, semantic databases, and other formal representations of biological concepts text mining systems have been able to effectively parse biological literature. While text mining systems are increasingly effective at creating the linkages required to provide context-specific search results, the systems themselves are difficult to set up and use by novice computer users due to the highly technical nature of the applications. Because most researchers in the biological sciences do not have a strong computer science background we have focused on improving the quality of existing, proven text mining systems by implementing a web-based GUI that greatly improves the workflow of these systems. Textpresso in particular has an excellent web-based interface for searching literature but does not have an easy to use administrative interface. We developed the Apellicon interface to enable a wide range of users to build and manage a Textpresso database. An important feature of Apellicon is that it can enable groups to collaborate in building a Textpresso database.","William Urbanski, Brian  Condie",2010-09-21

Support for Semantic Web technologies was also a priority in order to support interoperability with other neuroscience projects and knowledge bases. Current off-the-shelf semantic web or semantic wiki technologies, however, do not often lend themselves to simple user interaction designs for non-technical researchers and practitioners; the abstract nature and complexity of these systems acts as point of friction for user interaction, inhibiting usability and utility. Instead, we take an alternate interaction design approach driven by user centered design processes rather than a base set of semantic technologies.

The main features of our system are related to the efficient visualization of the neural activity, the possibility to define different connectivity rules and stimulation points, and the integration of statistical analysis tools for fast neural dynamics characterization. Our preliminary results show that we are able to reproduce both spontaneous and evoked activity of cultured networks. Hence, by defining a decoding strategy based on the Center of Activity, we carried out experiments with a simulated neuronal network in a closed-loop with a robot.

A Mechanism for Ultra-Slow Oscillations in the Cortical Default Network,/article/10.1007/s11538-010-9565-9,"When the brain is in its noncognitive “idling” state, functional MRI measurements reveal the activation of default cortical networks whose activity is suppressed during cognitive processing. This default or background mode is characterized by ultra-slow BOLD oscillations (∼0.05 Hz), signaling extremely slow cycling in cortical metabolic demand across distinct cortical regions. Here we describe a model of the cortex which predicts that slow cycling of cortical activity can arise naturally as a result of nonlinear interactions between temporal (Hopf) and spatial (Turing) instabilities. The Hopf instability is triggered by delays in the inhibitory postsynaptic response, while the Turing instability is precipitated by increases in the strength of the gap-junction coupling between interneurons. We comment on possible implications for slow dendritic computation and information processing.","Moira L. Steyn-Ross, D. A. Steyn-Ross, ... M. T. Wilson",2010-09-04

The candidate local areas of a moving object are followed by a blob detection processing including binarization, morphological closing and labeling methods. For identifying a moving object class, the proposed system uses a hybrid of global and local information in each local area. Although the global feature analysis is a compact way to identify an object and provide a good accuracy for non-occluded objects, it is sensitive to image translation and occlusion. Therefore, a local feature analysis is also considered and combined with the global feature analysis. In order to construct an efficient classifier using the global and local features, this study proposes a novel classifier based on boosting of support vector machines. The proposed object identification model can identify a class of moving object and discard unexpected candidate area which does not include an interesting object. As a result, the proposed road surveillance system is able to detect a moving object and identify the class of the moving object. Experimental results show that the proposed traffic surveillance system can successfully detect specific moving objects.","Jeong-Woo Woo, Wono Lee, Minho Lee",2010-10-28

Unexpected changes in direction of motion attract attention,/article/10.3758/BF03196685,"Under some circumstances, moving objects capture attention. Whether a change in the direction of a moving object attracts attention is still unexplored. We investigated this using a continuous tracking task. In Experiment 1, four grating patches changed smoothly and semirandomly in their positions and orientations, and observers attempted to track the orientations of two of them. After the stimuli disappeared, one of the two target gratings was queried and observers reported its orientation; hence direction of the gratings’ motion across the screen was an irrelevant feature. Despite the irrelevance of its motion, when the nonqueried grating had collided with an invisible boundary within the last 200 msec of the trial, accuracy reporting the queried grating was worse than when it had not. Attention was likely drawn by the unexpected nature of these changes in direction of motion, since the effect was eliminated when the boundaries were visible (Experiment 2). This tendency for unexpected motion changes to attract attention has important consequences for the monitoring of objects in everyday environments.","Christina J. Howard, Alex O. Holcombe",2010-11-01

Once a visionary dream of Golgi and Cajal, charting the mammalian connectome has been recently recognized as a pressing, if challenging, priority in biomedical research (e.g. Roysam et al. 2009). Different neuroscience sub-communities are targeting a broad range of scales, from the identification of all individual synapses in model organisms with electron microscopy, to long-range regional connections in the human brain with non-invasive imaging. How complete a connectome could realistically be expected in a finite time frame depends on the analytical level of detail.",Giorgio A. Ascoli,2010-02-03
Open Database of Epileptic EEG with MRI and Postoperational Assessment of Foci—a Real World Verification for the EEG Inverse Solutions,/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9086-6,"This paper introduces a freely accessible database http://eeg.pl/epi, containing 23 datasets from patients diagnosed with and operated on for drug-resistant epilepsy. This was collected as part of the clinical routine at the Warsaw Memorial Child Hospital. Each record contains (1) pre-surgical electroencephalography (EEG) recording (10–20 system) with inter-ictal discharges marked separately by an expert, (2) a full set of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for calculations of the realistic forward models, (3) structural placement of the epileptogenic zone, recognized by electrocorticography (ECoG) and post-surgical results, plotted on pre-surgical MRI scans in transverse, sagittal and coronal projections, (4) brief clinical description of each case. The main goal of this project is evaluation of possible improvements of localization of epileptic foci from the surface EEG recordings. These datasets offer a unique possibility for evaluating different EEG inverse solutions. We present preliminary results from a subset of these cases, including comparison of different schemes for the EEG inverse solution and preprocessing. We report also a finding which relates to the selective parametrization of single waveforms by multivariate matching pursuit, which is used in the preprocessing for the inverse solutions. It seems to offer a possibility of tracing the spatial evolution of seizures in time.","Piotr Zwoliński, Marcin Roszkowski, ... Piotr J. Durka",2010-09-25

Firing-rate model of a population of adaptive neurons,/article/10.1134/S0006350910040135,"A firing rate (FR) model for a population of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire neurons has been proposed. Unlike known FR models, it describes more precisely the unsteady firing regimes and takes into account the effect of slow potassium currents of spike adaptation. Approximations of the adaptive channel conductances are rewritten from voltage-dependent to spike-dependent and then to rate-dependent ones. The proposed FR model is compared with a very detailed population model, namely, the conductance-based Refractory Density model. This comparison shows the coincidence of the first peak of activity after the start of stimulation as well as of the stationary state. As an example of simulation of coupled adaptive neuronal populations, a ring model has been constructed, which reproduces a visual illusion known as tilt after-effect. The FR model is recommended for mathematical analysis of neuronal population activity as well as for computationally expensive large-scale network simulations.","A. Yu. Buchin, A. V.

DFBIdb: A Software Package for Neuroimaging Data Management,/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9080-z,"We present DFBIdb: a suite of tools for efficient management of neuroimaging project data. Specifically, DFBIdb was designed to allow users to quickly perform routine management tasks of sorting, archiving, exploring, exporting and organising raw data. DFBIdb was implemented as a collection of Python scripts that maintain a project-based, centralised database that is based on the XCEDE 2 data model. Project data is imported from a filesystem hierarchy of raw files, which is an often-used convention of imaging devices, using a single script that catalogues meta-data into a modified XCEDE 2 data model. During the import process data are reversibly anonymised, archived and compressed. The import script was designed to support multiple file formats and features an extensible framework that can be adapted to novel file formats. An ACL-based security model, with accompanying graphical management tools, was implemented to provide a straightforward method to restrict access to raw and meta-data. Graphical user interfaces are provided for data exploration. DFBIdb includes facilities to export, convert and organise customisable subsets of project data according to user-specified criteria. The command-line interface was implemented to allow users to incorporate database commands into more complex scripts that may be utilised to automate data management tasks. By using DFBIdb, neuroimaging laboratories will be able to perform routine data management tasks in an efficient manner.","Christopher L. Adamson, Amanda G. Wood",2010-09-14

Cluster associative memory formation in a three-layer network of phase oscillators,/article/10.1134/S0006350910020181,"A three-layer network model of oscillatory associative memory is proposed. The network is capable of storing binary images, which can be retrieved upon presenting an appropriate stimulus. Binary images are encoded in the form of the spatial distribution of oscillatory phase clusters in-phase and anti-phase relative to a reference periodic signal. The information is loaded into the network using a set of interlayer connection weights. A condition for error-free pattern retrieval is formulated, delimiting the maximal number of patterns to be stored in the memory (storage capacity). It is shown that the capacity can be significantly increased by generating an optimal alphabet (basis pattern set). The number of stored patterns can reach values of the network size (the number of oscillators in each layer), which is significantly higher than the capacity of conventional oscillatory memory models. The dynamical and information characteristics of the retrieval process based on the optimal alphabet, including the size of “attraction basins“ and the input pattern distortion admissible for error-free retrieval, are investigated.","A.

Federated Web-accessible Clinical Data Management within an Extensible NeuroImaging Database,/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9078-6,"Managing vast datasets collected throughout multiple clinical imaging communities has become critical with the ever increasing and diverse nature of datasets. Development of data management infrastructure is further complicated by technical and experimental advances that drive modifications to existing protocols and acquisition of new types of research data to be incorporated into existing data management systems. In this paper, an extensible data management system for clinical neuroimaging studies is introduced: The Human Clinical Imaging Database (HID) and Toolkit. The database schema is constructed to support the storage of new data types without changes to the underlying schema. The complex infrastructure allows management of experiment data, such as image protocol and behavioral task parameters, as well as subject-specific data, including demographics, clinical assessments, and behavioral task performance metrics. Of significant interest, embedded clinical data entry and management tools enhance both consistency of data reporting and automatic entry of data into the database. The Clinical Assessment Layout Manager (CALM) allows users to create on-line data entry forms for use within and across sites, through which data is pulled into the underlying database via the generic clinical assessment management engine (GAME). Importantly, the system is designed to operate in a distributed environment, serving both human users and client applications in a service-oriented manner. Querying capabilities use a built-in multi-database parallel query builder/result combiner, allowing web-accessible queries within and across multiple federated databases. The system along with its documentation is open-source and available from the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resource Clearinghouse (NITRC) site.","I. Burak Ozyurt, David B. Keator, ...

Neural Population Modes Capture Biologically Realistic Large Scale Network Dynamics,/article/10.1007/s11538-010-9573-9,"Large scale brain networks are understood nowadays to underlie the emergence of cognitive functions, though the detailed mechanisms are hitherto unknown. The challenges in the study of large scale brain networks are amongst others their high dimensionality requiring significant computational efforts, the complex connectivity across brain areas and the associated transmission delays, as well as the stochastic nature of neuronal processes. To decrease the computational effort, neurons are clustered into neural masses, which then are approximated by reduced descriptions of population dynamics. Here, we implement a neural population mode approach (Assisi et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 94(1):018106, 2005; Stefanescu and Jirsa in PLoS Comput. Biol. 4(11):e1000219, 2008), which parsimoniously captures various types of population behavior. We numerically demonstrate that the reduced population mode system favorably captures the high-dimensional dynamics of neuron networks with an architecture involving homogeneous local connectivity and a large-scale, fiber-like connection with time delay.","Viktor K.

Experimental results indicate that both algorithms can provide efficient data transfer under various circumstances.","Muzhou Xiong, Dan Chen, ... Song Wu",2010-04-01

Spike Train Analysis Toolkit: Enabling Wider Application of Information-Theoretic Techniques to Neurophysiology,/article/10.1007/s12021-009-9049-y,"Conventional methods widely available for the analysis of spike trains and related neural data include various time- and frequency-domain analyses, such as peri-event and interspike interval histograms, spectral measures, and probability distributions. Information theoretic methods are increasingly recognized as significant tools for the analysis of spike train data. However, developing robust implementations of these methods can be time-consuming, and determining applicability to neural recordings can require expertise. In order to facilitate more widespread adoption of these informative methods by the neuroscience community, we have developed the Spike Train Analysis Toolkit. STAToolkit is a software package which implements, documents, and guides application of several information-theoretic spike train analysis techniques, thus minimizing the effort needed to adopt and use them. This implementation behaves like a typical Matlab toolbox, but the underlying computations are coded in C for portability, optimized for efficiency, and interfaced with Matlab via the MEX framework. STAToolkit runs on any of three major platforms: Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The toolkit reads input from files with an easy-to-generate text-based, platform-independent format. STAToolkit, including full documentation and test cases, is freely available open source via http://neuroanalysis.org, maintained as a resource for the computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics communities.

iqr: A Tool for the Construction of Multi-level Simulations of Brain and Behaviour,/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9069-7,"The brain is the most complex system we know of. Despite the wealth of data available in neuroscience, our understanding of this system is still very limited. Here we argue that an essential component in our arsenal of methods to advance our understanding of the brain is the construction of artificial brain-like systems. In this way we can encompass the multi-level organisation of the brain and its role in the context of the complete embodied real-world and real-time perceiving and behaving system. Hence, on the one hand, we must be able to develop and validate theories of brains as closing the loop between perception and action, and on the other hand as interacting with the real world. Evidence is growing that one of the sources of the computational power of neuronal systems lies in the massive and specific connectivity, rather than the complexity of single elements. To meet these challenges—multiple levels of organisation, sophisticated connectivity, and the interaction of neuronal models with the real-world—we have developed a multi-level neuronal simulation environment, iqr. This framework deals with these requirements by directly transforming them into the core elements of the simulation environment itself. iqr provides a means to design complex neuronal models graphically, and to visualise and analyse their properties on-line. In iqr connectivity is defined in a flexible, yet compact way, and simulations run at a high speed, which allows the control of real-world devices—robots in the broader sense—in real-time. The architecture of iqr is modular, providing the possibility to write new neuron, and synapse types, and custom interfaces to other hardware systems. The code of iqr is publicly accessible under the GNU General Public License (GPL). iqr has been in use since 1996 and has been the core tool for a large number of studies ranging from detailed models of neuronal systems like the cerebral cortex, and the cerebellum, to robot based models of perception, cognition and action to large-scale real-world systems. In addition, iqr has been widely used over many years to introduce students to neuronal simulation and neuromorphic control. In this paper we outline the conceptual and methodological background of iqr and its design philosophy. Thereafter we present iqr’s main features and computational properties. Finally, we describe a number of projects using iqr, singling out how iqr is used for building a “synthetic insect”.","Ulysses Bernardet, Paul F. M. J. Verschure",2010-05-26

Behavioral analysis of differential hebbian learning in closed-loop systems,/article/10.1007/s00422-010-0396-4,"Understanding closed loop behavioral systems is a non-trivial problem, especially when they change during learning. Descriptions of closed loop systems in terms of information theory date back to the 1950s, however, there have been only a few attempts which take into account learning, mostly measuring information of inputs. In this study we analyze a specific type of closed loop system by looking at the input as well as the output space. For this, we investigate simulated agents that perform differential Hebbian learning (STDP). In the first part we show that analytical solutions can be found for the temporal development of such systems for relatively simple cases. In the second part of this study we try to answer the following question: How can we predict which system from a given class would be the best for a particular scenario? This question is addressed using energy, input/output ratio and entropy measures and investigating their development during learning. This way we can show that within well-specified scenarios there are indeed agents which are optimal with respect to their structure and adaptive properties.","Tomas Kulvicius, Christoph Kolodziejski, ...

Path planning versus cue responding: a bio-inspired model of switching between navigation strategies,/article/10.1007/s00422-010-0400-z,"In this article, we describe a new computational model of switching between path-planning and cue-guided navigation strategies. It is based on three main assumptions: (i) the strategies are mediated by separate memory systems that learn independently and in parallel; (ii) the learning algorithms are different in the two memory systems—the cue-guided strategy uses a temporal-difference (TD) learning rule to approach a visible goal, whereas the path-planning strategy relies on a place-cell-based graph-search algorithm to learn the location of a hidden goal; (iii) a strategy selection mechanism uses TD-learning rule to choose the most successful strategy based on past experience. We propose a novel criterion for strategy selection based on the directions of goal-oriented movements suggested by the different strategies. We show that the selection criterion based on this “common currency” is capable of choosing the best among TD-learning and planning strategies and can be used to solve navigational tasks in continuous state and action spaces. The model has been successfully applied to reproduce rat behavior in two water-maze tasks in which the two strategies were shown to interact. The model was used to analyze competitive and cooperative interactions between different strategies during these tasks as well as relative influence of different types of sensory cues.","Laurent Dollé, Denis Sheynikhovich, ...

The “recognizing cell” model for simulation of feed-forward interaction in the cognitive system: Numerical experiment and psychophysical data,/article/10.3103/S1060992X09030096,The study represents a research into the influence of the feed-forward pre-tuning on the dynamical modes of models of the homogeneous neural-inspired systems when identifying fundamental features in informational signal. On the basis of calculations and received data we put forward a hypothesis about the mechanisms of influence of the sensory signal context on the absolute thresholds of the perception of primitive features. We introduce psychophysical measures which verify the introduced model and we have experimentally determined typical characteristic periods in feed-forward connection dynamics which allow to tune the mathematical model for reproduction of individual modes of singling out a feature.,"S.

Development of Neural Electromagnetic Ontologies (NEMO): Ontology-based Tools for Representation and Integration of Event-related Brain Potentials,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2009.3458.1,"We describe a first-generation ontology forrepresentation and integration of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The ontology is designed following OBO “best practices” and is augmented with tools to perform ontology-based labeling and annotation of ERP data, and a database that enables semantically based reasoning over these data. Because certain high-level concepts in the ERP domain are illdefined, we have developed methods to support coordinated updates to each of these three components. This approach consists of “top-down” (knowledge-driven) design and implementation, followed by “bottom-up” (data-driven) validation and refinement. Our goal is to build an ERP ontology that is logically valid, empirically sound, robust in application, and transparent to users. This ontology will be used to support sharing and meta-analysis of EEG and MEG data collected within our Neural Electromagnetic Ontologies (NEMO) project.","Gwen Frishkoff, Paea LePendu, ...

Efficient current-based optimization techniques for parameter estimation in multi-compartment neuronal models,/article/10.1186/1471-2202-10-S1-P347,"Estimation of the maximal ion channel conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley models from patch clamp data is a difficult optimization problem. Automating this process promises high-throughput computational modeling of use to both experimenters (for rapid feedback on their experimental preparations) and modelers (for investigating the details of neuronal function). Hitherto, attempts to do this have focused on stochastic searches such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing [1–3]. Such methods give robust estimates of model parameters but converge slowly or need to sample a large population of test cases in parallel, and therefore require substantial computing resources. Meanwhile, deterministic searches (e.g. the simplex search and conjugate gradient descent) are far more computationally efficient but are hampered by the complex fitting landscape of the optimization problem. As such, there is no general neuronal parameter-fitting algorithm that is both computationally efficient and robust.","Nathan F Lepora, Paul G Overton, Kevin Gurney",2009-07-13
The HoneyBee Standard Brain (HSB) – a versatile atlas tool for integrating data and data exchange in the neuroscience community,/article/10.1186/1471-2202-10-S1-P1,"The HoneyBee Standard Brain (HSB) serves as an interactive tool for comparing morphologies of bee brain neurons and relates it to functional as well as biological properties [1]. Recent efforts by several labs have accumulated confocal image stacks from extra- and intracellular stained neurons in the bee central nervous system [2]. We present a pipeline through which confocal images of neurons can be traced and presented in a common space (Figure 1). The first step is an automatic extraction of the neuron's skeleton based on threshold segmentation. In a second step this skeleton can be edited using semi-automatic and interactive tools within Amira's Filament Editor. Hereby, the user is assisted by displaying maximum intensity projections and 3D representations in two separate viewers. Next the skeletonized neuron can be labeled (i.e. annotated) by using multiple sets of hierarchically organized label attributes (Figure 2). Finally, the neuron's topological and metric features can be visualized, statistically analyzed and/or exported to a simulation package such as Neuron.","Jürgen Rybak, Anja Kuß, ...

Musings of a Post-Stimulus Mind…,/article/10.1007/s12021-009-9050-5,"The current global economic downturn affects us all in many different ways. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009Footnote 1 includes support designed to stimulate the economy of medical research for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2009 and 2010, in part through funds directed to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) for this purpose. One sweeping, general-purpose, investigator-initiated funding opportunity was undertaken recently using a new grant mechanism and process, entitled “Recovery Act Limited Competition: NIH Challenge Grants in Health and Science Research (RC1)”.Footnote 2 Constrained in scope to specific ‘Challenge Topics’, identified by the various NIH Institutes and Centers, this program can be considered the front-line of attack on the psychological doldrums that had begun to infect the research community in light of the recent economic downturn (as well as other, hopefully temporary, drains on the US tax dollar) that has resulted in dramatic reductions in availability of research support. It can certainly be said that this program has ‘stimulated’ a lot of talk, thought, and brainstorming for new and exciting ideas in order to compete for this funding. The actual economic stimulation of the RC1 program, however, cannot be expected to be substantial, as the math clearly shows: there are ~200 awards expected to be made, out of approximately 1,000 ‘Challenge Topic’ areas, from an anticipated pool of multiple thousands of applicants. Depending upon the actual number of applications received (now estimated at over 15,000), one can rest assured that this will be a much harder grant to get than the typical ‘regular’ research grant, even in this economic climate. So, yes, $200M will flow into the research economy, but at what cost in the redirection of the intellectual focus of the community over the past months? But alas, leaving the mathematical improbabilities aside like a seasoned lottery ticket purchaser, my ‘see a grant opportunity—write a grant’ mentality drew me into the fray of frenzied and frenetic fundraising festivities. In the aftermath of this process, I find myself left with only a few spare non-refractory neurons in order to piece together an insightful set of editorial comments for this issue.

Run-Time Interoperability Between Neuronal Network Simulators Based on the MUSIC Framework,/article/10.1007/s12021-010-9064-z,"MUSIC is a standard API allowing large scale neuron simulators to exchange data within a parallel computer during runtime.

We provide experiences from the implementation of MUSIC interfaces for two neuronal network simulators of different kinds, NEST and MOOSE. A multi-simulation of a cortico-striatal network model involving both simulators is performed, demonstrating how MUSIC can promote inter-operability between models written for different simulators and how these can be re-used to build a larger model system. Benchmarks show that the MUSIC pilot implementation provides efficient data transfer in a cluster computer with good scaling. We conclude that MUSIC fulfills the design goal that it should be simple to adapt existing simulators to use MUSIC. In addition, since the MUSIC API enforces independence of the applications, the multi-simulation could be built from pluggable component modules without adaptation of the components to each other in terms of simulation time-step or topology of connections between the modules.","Mikael Djurfeldt, Johannes Hjorth, ...

Issues in the Design of a Pilot Concept-Based Query Interface for the Neuroinformatics Information Framework,/article/10.1007/s12021-008-9035-9,"This paper describes a pilot query interface that has been constructed to help us explore a “concept-based” approach for searching the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF). The query interface is concept-based in the sense that the search terms submitted through the interface are selected from a standardized vocabulary of terms (concepts) that are structured in the form of an ontology. The NIF contains three primary resources: the NIF Resource Registry, the NIF Document Archive, and the NIF Database Mediator. These NIF resources are very different in their nature and therefore pose challenges when designing a single interface from which searches can be automatically launched against all three resources simultaneously. The paper first discusses briefly several background issues involving the use of standardized biomedical vocabularies in biomedical information retrieval, and then presents a detailed example that illustrates how the pilot concept-based query interface operates. The paper concludes by discussing certain lessons learned in the development of the current version of the interface.","Luis Marenco, Yuli Li, ... Perry L. Miller",2008-09-01

Regularized multiple criteria linear programs for classification,/article/10.1007/s11432-009-0126-5,"Although multiple criteria mathematical program (MCMP), as an alternative method of classification, has been used in various real-life data mining problems, its mathematical structure of solvability is still challengeable. This paper proposes a regularized multiple criteria linear program (RMCLP) for two classes of classification problems. It first adds some regularization terms in the objective function of the known multiple criteria linear program (MCLP) model for possible existence of solution. Then the paper describes the mathematical framework of the solvability. Finally, a series of experimental tests are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed RMCLP with the existing methods: MCLP, multiple criteria quadratic program (MCQP), and support vector machine (SVM). The results of four publicly available datasets and a real-life credit dataset all show that RMCLP is a competitive method in classification. Furthermore, this paper explores an ordinal RMCLP (ORMCLP) model for ordinal multi-group problems. Comparing ORMCLP with traditional methods such as One-Against-One, One-Against-The rest on large-scale credit card dataset, experimental results show that both ORMCLP and RMCLP perform well.","Yong Shi, YingJie Tian, ...

The performances of three statistics were first quantitatively tested using five different coupled systems including both deterministic and stochastic models, i.e., coupled broadband noises, Lorenz–Lorenz, Rossler–Rossler, Rossler–Lorenz, and neural mass model. All the measures were compared with each other with respect to their ability to distinguish between different levels of coupling and their robustness against noise. The three measures were then applied to a real-life problem, pattern synchronization analysis of left and right hemisphere rat electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Both simulated and real EEG data analysis results showed that the X-FuzzyEn provided an improved evaluation of bivariate series pattern synchronization and could be more conveniently and powerfully applied to different neural dynamical systems contaminated by noise.","Hong-Bo Xie, Jing-Yi Guo, Yong-Ping Zheng",2009-12-23

Our method includes special collective (holographic) analysis of stock-Index correlations, of nested stock correlations (including the Index as an additional ghost stock) and of bare stock correlations (after subtraction of the Index return from the stocks returns). Our findings verify and strongly substantiate the assumed functional role of the index in the financial system as a cohesive force between stocks, i.e., the correlations between stocks are largely due to the strong correlation between each stock and the Index (the adhesive effect), rather than inter-stock dependencies. The Index adhesive and cohesive effects on the market correlations in the two markets are presented and compared in a reduced 3-D principal component space of the correlation matrices (holographic presentation).

The problem of determination of the model class of geolectric structures corresponding to the presented input MT data is solved with the use of the neural network classifier constructed for the available set of model classes of structures.

Analysis of single unit activity evoked by tones amplitude-modulated with low-frequency noise in frog medulla,/article/10.1134/S0006350909050157,A method of constructing shuffled autocorrelation functions (SACF) was used to characterize single units in the dorsal medullar nucleus of the common frog (Rana temporaria). A continuous characteristic frequency tone modulated by repeating pieces of low-frequency noise was used as a stimulus. SACF was calculated as the correlation between the firing discharges evoked by different repeating pieces of the low-frequency noise. This approach obviates the influence of refractoriness and also considerably increases the sample representativity. Comparison of the SACF with the conventional ACF permits estimating the temporal dynamics of changes in the postspike excitability of the neuron. Analysis of several examples demonstrates the possibility of facilitation just after the period of absolute refractoriness in some tonic units. Neurons exhibiting only a phasic response to the onset of nonmodulated voice-frequency pieces were able to selectively respond to special moments of noise amplitude modulation. These cells demonstrate extremely high synchronism of reaction. We also describe a neuron characterized by an intrinsic periodicity of firing not connected with the dynamics of arriving stimuli.,"N.

The Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium,/article/10.1186/1744-9081-5-4,"The Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium (NPRC) was conceived in the summer of 2007 at a meeting of editors and publishers of neuroscience journals. One of the working groups addressed whether it was possible to construct a system for permitting authors whose manuscript received supportive reviews at one journal but was not accepted to send a revised manuscript together with its first round of reviews to a new journal for the second round. This would speed up the review process and reduce the work for reviewers and editors. The working group not only designed a framework for transferring reviews among journals, but also implemented it as the NPRC. By the fall of 2007, more than a dozen major journals had signed onto the NPRC, sufficient to launch the experiment in January, 2008. We invite authors who have not yet used the NPRC to try this method for appropriate manuscripts.","Clifford B Saper, John HR Maunsell, Terje Sagvolden",2009-01-16
Database Analysis of Simulated and Recorded Electrophysiological Datasets with PANDORA’s Toolbox,/article/10.1007/s12021-009-9048-z,"Neuronal recordings and computer simulations produce ever growing amounts of data, impeding conventional analysis methods from keeping pace. Such large datasets can be automatically analyzed by taking advantage of the well-established relational database paradigm. Raw electrophysiology data can be entered into a database by extracting its interesting characteristics (e.g., firing rate). Compared to storing the raw data directly, this database representation is several orders of magnitude higher efficient in storage space and processing time. Using two large electrophysiology recording and simulation datasets, we demonstrate that the database can be queried, transformed and analyzed. This process is relatively simple and easy to learn because it takes place entirely in Matlab, using our database analysis toolbox, PANDORA. It is capable of acquiring data from common recording and simulation platforms and exchanging data with external database engines and other analysis toolboxes, which make analysis simpler and highly interoperable. PANDORA is available to be freely used and modified because it is open-source (http://software.incf.org/software/pandora/home).","Cengiz Günay, Jeremy R. Edgerton, ... Dieter Jaeger",2009-05-28
Modularity maps reveal community structure in the resting human brain,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2009.3069.1,"The brain is a complex network of interconnecting neurons that combines regional specificity with distributed processing. Recent advances in the field of network theory have facilitated ground-breaking analyses demonstrating that brain connectivity exhibits small-world properties similar to other self-organized networks such as the internet, the genome, or even social organizations. Brain connectivity supports local and global processing through high clustering and short connectivity paths, respectively. While these comprehensive network indices highlight the global organization of the network, the regional specificity is related to the interconnectivity of local neighborhoods within the global system. The work presented here evaluated the community structure of resting human brain networks to identify the local neighborhoods and map those interconnected areas back to the brain. The study identified predictable clustering in unisensory cortices. However, the unexpected community structure in the default-mode network (DMN) revealed three separate modules and included the lateral frontal cortices in addition to traditional DMN regions. These results are the first to map modularity across the entire brain without restricting analyses to predefined anatomical structures. Such analyses provide an unbiased view of network communities and promise to provide new insights into organization of the brain. Evaluation of modular brain structure across states, during demanding tasks, or in disease populations will reveal dynamic connectivity changes in whole-brain networks.","Paul Laurienti, Christina Hugenschmidt, Satoru Hayasaka",2009-04-17

NETMORPH: A Framework for the Stochastic Generation of Large Scale Neuronal Networks With Realistic Neuron Morphologies,/article/10.1007/s12021-009-9052-3,"We present a simulation framework, called NETMORPH, for the developmental generation of 3D large-scale neuronal networks with realistic neuron morphologies. In NETMORPH, neuronal morphogenesis is simulated from the perspective of the individual growth cone. For each growth cone in a growing axonal or dendritic tree, its actions of elongation, branching and turning are described in a stochastic, phenomenological manner. In this way, neurons with realistic axonal and dendritic morphologies, including neurite curvature, can be generated. Synapses are formed as neurons grow out and axonal and dendritic branches come in close proximity of each other. NETMORPH is a flexible tool that can be applied to a wide variety of research questions regarding morphology and connectivity. Research applications include studying the complex relationship between neuronal morphology and global patterns of synaptic connectivity. Possible future developments of NETMORPH are discussed.","Randal A. Koene, Betty Tijms, ... Arjen van Ooyen",2009-08-12

Improved observer dependent perception of weak edges when scanning an image in real time indicated by introducing 1/f noise into the primary visual cortex V1. Theory and experimental support,/article/10.1007/BF03178641,We present results of a new process for generating 1/f type noise sequences and introducing the noise in the primary visual cortex which then enables improved perception of weak edges when an observer is scanning a complex image in real time to detect detail such as in mammogram reading sessions. It can be explained by an adaptation of information theory for functional rather than previous task-based methods for formulating processes for edge formation in early vision. This is enabled from a two “species” classification of the interaction of opposing on-centre and off-centre neuron processes. We show that non-stationary stochastic resonances predicted by theory can occur with 1/f  noise in the primary visual cortex V1 and suggest that signalling exchanges between V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus can initiate neural activity for saccadic action (and observer attention) for weak edge perception. Improvements predicted by our theory were shown from 600 observations by two groups of observers of limited experience and an experienced radiologist for reference (but not for diagnosis). They scanned and rated the definition of microcalcification in clusters separately rated by the experienced radiologist. The results and supporting theory showed dependence on the observer’s attention and orderly scanning. Using a compact simplified equipment configuration the methodology has important clinical applications for conjunction searches of features and for detection of objects in poor light conditions for vehicles.,"E.

Jamming and correlation patterns in traffic of information on sparse modular networks,/article/10.1140/epjb/e2009-00190-7,"We study high-density traffic of information packets on sparse modular networks with scale-free subgraphs. With different statistical measures we distinguish between the free flow and congested regime and point out the role of modules in the jamming transition. We further consider correlations between traffic signals collected at each node in the network. The correlation matrix between pairs of signals reflects the network modularity in the eigenvalue spectrum and the structure of eigenvectors. The internal structure of the modules has an important role in the diffusion dynamics, leading to enhanced correlations between the modular hubs, which can not be filtered out by standard methods. Implications for the analysis of real networks with unknown modular structure are discussed.","B. Tadić, M. Mitrović",2009-06-16

Performance evaluation of pure-motion tasks for mobile robots with respect to world models,/article/10.1007/s10514-009-9150-y,"The evaluation of the performance of robot motion methods and systems is still an open challenge, although substantial progress has been made in the field over the years. On the one hand, these techniques cannot be evaluated off-line, on the other hand, they are deeply influenced by the task, the environment and the specific representation chosen for it. In this paper we concentrate on “pure-motion tasks”: tasks that require to move the robot from one configuration to another, either being an independent sub-task of a more complex plan or representing a goal by itself. After characterizing the goals and the tasks, we describe the commonly-used problem decomposition and different kinds of modeling that can be used, from accurate metric maps to minimalistic representations. The contribution of this paper is an evaluation framework that we adopt in a set of experiments showing how the performance of the motion system can be affected by the use of different kinds of environment representations.","Daniele Calisi, Daniele Nardi",2009-09-01
A new multicompartmental reaction-diffusion modeling method links transient membrane attachment of E. coli MinE to E-ring formation,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2009.3845.1,"Many important cellular processes are regulated by reaction-diffusion (RD) of molecules that takes place both in the cytoplasm and on the membrane. To model and analyze such multicompartmental processes, we developed a lattice-based Monte Carlo method, Spatiocyte that supports RD in volume and surface compartments at single molecule resolution. Stochasticity in RD and the excluded volume effect brought by intracellular molecular crowding, both of which can significantly affect RD and thus, cellular processes, are also supported. We verified the method by comparing simulation results of diffusion, irreversible and reversible reactions with the predicted analytical and best available numerical solutions. Moreover, to directly compare the localization patterns of molecules in fluorescence microscopy images with simulation, we devised a visualization method that mimics the microphotography process by showing the trajectory of simulated molecules averaged according to the camera exposure time. In the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli, the division site is suppressed at the cell poles by periodic pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min proteins (MinC, MinD and MinE) arising from carefully orchestrated RD in both cytoplasm and membrane compartments. Using Spatiocyte we could model and reproduce the in vivo MinDE localization dynamics by accounting for the established properties of MinE. Our results suggest that the MinE ring, which is essential in preventing polar septation, is largely composed of MinE that is transiently attached to the membrane independently after recruited by MinD. Overall, Spatiocyte allows simulation and visualization of complex spatial and reaction-diffusion mediated cellular processes in volumes and surfaces. As we showed, it can potentially provide mechanistic insights otherwise difficult to obtain experimentally.","Satya Arjunan, Masaru Tomita",2009-10-09

Delineated structures in a given atlas, however, are often difficult to interpret and to interface with database systems that supply additional information using hierarchically organized vocabularies (ontologies). Here we discuss the concept of volume-to-ontology mapping in the context of macroscopical brain structures. We present Java tools with which we have implemented this concept for retrieval of mapping and connectivity data on the macaque brain from the CoCoMac database in connection with an electronic version of “The Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates” authored by George Paxinos and colleagues. The software, including our manually drawn monkey brain template, can be downloaded freely under the GNU General Public License. It adds value to the printed atlas and has a wider (neuro-)informatics application since it can read appropriately annotated data from delineated sections of other species and organs, and turn them into 3D registered stacks. The tools provide additional features, including visualization and analysis of connectivity data, volume and centre-of-mass estimates, and graphical manipulation of entire structures, which are potentially useful for a range of research and teaching applications.","Gleb Bezgin, Andrew T.

Poincaré–Cosserat Equations for the Lighthill Three-dimensional Large Amplitude Elongated Body Theory: Application to Robotics,/article/10.1007/s00332-009-9050-5,"In this article, we describe a dynamic model of the three-dimensional eel swimming. This model is analytical and suited to the online control of eel-like robots. The proposed solution is based on the Large Amplitude Elongated Body Theory of Lighthill and a framework recently presented in Boyer et al. (IEEE Trans. Robot. 22:763–775, 2006) for the dynamic modeling of hyper-redundant robots. This framework was named “macro-continuous” since, at this macroscopic scale, the robot (or the animal) is considered as a Cosserat beam internally (and continuously) actuated. This article introduces new results in two directions. Firstly, it extends the Lighthill theory to the case of a self-propelled body swimming in three dimensions, while including a model of the internal control torque. Secondly, this generalization of the Lighthill model is achieved due to a new set of equations, which are also derived in this article. These equations generalize the Poincaré equations of a Cosserat beam to an open system containing a fluid stratified around the slender beam.","Frederic Boyer, Mathieu Porez, Alban Leroyer",2009-08-13

Brain Derived Vision Algorithm on High Performance Architectures,/article/10.1007/s10766-009-0106-9,"Even though computing systems have increased the number of transistors, the switching speed, and the number of processors, most programs exhibit limited speedup due to the serial dependencies of existing algorithms. Analysis of intrinsically parallel systems such as brain circuitry have led to the identification of novel architecture designs, and also new algorithms than can exploit the features of modern multiprocessor systems. In this article we describe the details of a brain derived vision (BDV) algorithm that is derived from the anatomical structure, and physiological operating principles of thalamo-cortical brain circuits. We show that many characteristics of the BDV algorithm lend themselves to implementation on IBM CELL architecture, and yield impressive speedups that equal or exceed the performance of specialized solutions such as FPGAs. Mapping this algorithm to the IBM CELL is non-trivial, and we suggest various approaches to deal with parallelism, task granularity, communication, and memory locality. We also show that a cluster of three PS3s (or more) containing IBM CELL processors provides a promising platform for brain derived algorithms, exhibiting speedup of more than 140 × over a desktop PC implementation, and thus enabling real-time object recognition for robotic systems.","Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran, Andrew Felch, ...

Core NIF terminologies use a straightforward syntax designed for ease of use and for navigation by familiar web interfaces, and readily exportable to aid development of relational-model databases for neuroscience data sharing. Datasets, data analysis tools, web resources, and other entities are characterized by multiple descriptors, each addressing core concepts, including data type, acquisition technique, neuroanatomy, and cell class. Terms for each concept are organized in a tree structure, providing is-a and has-a relations. Broad general terms near each root span the category or concept and spawn more detailed entries for specificity. Related but distinct concepts (e.g., brain area and depth) are specified by separate trees, for easier navigation than would be required by graph representation. Semantics enabling NIF data discovery were selected at one or more workshops by investigators expert in particular systems (vision, olfaction, behavioral neuroscience, neurodevelopment), brain areas (cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus), preparations (molluscs, fly), diseases (neurodegenerative disease), or techniques (microscopy, computation and modeling, neurogenetics).

Determining the total ozone from geostationary earth satellites,/article/10.1134/S000143380806008X,"A method for determining the total ozone (TO) with high spatial (3×3 km2) and temporal (15 min) resolutions by using measurements of the Earth’s outgoing thermal radiation from Meteosat geostationary satellites is proposed. The method is based on measurements with a SEVIRI instrument (eight IR channels) and involves additional information on the three-dimensional field of the atmospheric temperature and on the surface temperature obtained from polar satellites (AIRS instrument). The inverse problem of TO determination is solved by the method of neural networks. TO measurements with the AIRS instrument are also used for training the neural networks. Ground-based TO measurements at the international ozonometric network are used for controlling the quality of AIRS data and detecting the errors of the proposed method of TO determination from SEVIRI data. The mean and rms differences between TO values obtained with the use of the proposed method and from the results of measurements at the international ozonometric network are shown to be 1.5 and 6.5%, respectively. Examples of TO distributions reconstructed with high spatial and temporal resolutions are presented. These examples show that the elaborated method for solving various scientific and applied problems and, in particular, for investigating stratospheric dynamics is promising.","A. V. Polyakov, Yu. M.

We observe self-sustained persistent fluctuations of activity which can be classified into two types (one of which is similar to that seen in network models of discrete excitable neurons, the other being particular to this model). We study the effect of parameters such as system size and the range, number and strength of connections, on the probability that a particular realisation of the connections is able to exhibit persistent fluctuations.","C.

The NLB collects these links from each resource and passes them to the NCBI which incorporates them into its Entrez LinkOut service. In this way, an Entrez user looking at a specific Entrez entry can LinkOut directly to related neuroscience information. The information stored in the NLB can also be utilized in other ways. A second approach, which is operational on a pilot basis, is for the NLB Web server to create dynamically its own Web page of LinkOut links for each NCBI identifier in the NLB database.

Recently, a high-capacity network to store familiarity has been proposed. Here we derive analytically the optimal learning rule for such a familiarity memory using a signal- to-noise ratio analysis. We find that in the limit of large networks the covariance rule, known to be the optimal local, linear learning rule for pattern association, is also the optimal learning rule for familiarity discrimination. In the limit of large networks, the capacity is independent of the sparseness of the patterns and the corresponding information capacity is 0.057 bits per synapse, which is somewhat less than typically found for associative networks.","Andrea Greve, David C.

Characterizing Dynamic Functional Connectivity Across Sleep Stages from EEG,/article/10.1007/s10548-008-0071-4,"Following a nonlinear dynamics approach, we investigated the emergence of functional clusters which are related with spontaneous brain activity during sleep. Based on multichannel EEG traces from 10 healthy subjects, we compared the functional connectivity across different sleep stages. Our exploration commences with the conjecture of a small-world patterning, present in the scalp topography of the measured electrical activity. The existence of such a communication pattern is first confirmed for our data and then precisely determined by means of two distinct measures of non-linear interdependence between time-series. A graph encapsulating the small-world network structure along with the relative interdependence strength is formed for each sleep stage and subsequently fed to a suitable clustering procedure. Finally the delineated graph components are comparatively presented for all stages revealing novel attributes of sleep architecture. Our results suggest a pivotal role for the functional coupling during the different stages and indicate interesting dynamic characteristics like its variable hemispheric asymmetry and the isolation between anterior and posterior cortical areas during REM.","Stavros I.

The Eye of a Mathematical Physicist,/article/10.1007/s10955-009-9719-z,"In this essay we are searching for neural correlates of ‘doing mathematical physics’. We introduce a toy model of a mathematical physicist, a brain connected with the outside world only by vision and saccadic eye movements and interacting with a computer screen. First, we describe the neuroanatomy of the visuo-saccadic system and Listing’s law, which binds saccades and the optics of the eye. Then we explain space-time transformations in the superior colliculus, the performance of a canonical cortical circuit in the frontal eye field and finally the recurrent interaction of both areas, which leads to a coherent percept of space in spite of saccades. This sets the stage in the brain for doing mathematical physics, which is analyzed in simple examples.",Klaus Hepp,2009-03-25
Automated neuron model optimization techniques: a review,/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0257-6,"The increase in complexity of computational neuron models makes the hand tuning of model parameters more difficult than ever. Fortunately, the parallel increase in computer power allows scientists to automate this tuning. Optimization algorithms need two essential components. The first one is a function that measures the difference between the output of the model with a given set of parameter and the data. This error function or fitness function makes the ranking of different parameter sets possible. The second component is a search algorithm that explores the parameter space to find the best parameter set in a minimal amount of time. In this review we distinguish three types of error functions: feature-based ones, point-by-point comparison of voltage traces and multi-objective functions. We then detail several popular search algorithms, including brute-force methods, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, differential evolution and particle-swarm optimization. Last, we shortly describe Neurofitter, a free software package that combines a phase–plane trajectory density fitness function with several search algorithms.","W. Van Geit, E. De Schutter, P.

A Java-based fMRI Processing Pipeline Evaluation System for Assessment of Univariate General Linear Model and Multivariate Canonical Variate Analysis-based Pipelines,/article/10.1007/s12021-008-9014-1,"As functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) becomes widely used, the demands for evaluation of fMRI processing pipelines and validation of fMRI analysis results is increasing rapidly. The current NPAIRS package, an IDL-based fMRI processing pipeline evaluation framework, lacks system interoperability and the ability to evaluate general linear model (GLM)-based pipelines using prediction metrics. Thus, it can not fully evaluate fMRI analytical software modules such as FSL.FEAT and NPAIRS.GLM. In order to overcome these limitations, a Java-based fMRI processing pipeline evaluation system was developed. It integrated YALE (a machine learning environment) into Fiswidgets (a fMRI software environment) to obtain system interoperability and applied an algorithm to measure GLM prediction accuracy. The results demonstrated that the system can evaluate fMRI processing pipelines with univariate GLM and multivariate canonical variates analysis (CVA)-based models on real fMRI data based on prediction accuracy (classification accuracy) and statistical parametric image (SPI) reproducibility. In addition, a preliminary study was performed where four fMRI processing pipelines with GLM and CVA modules such as FSL.FEAT and NPAIRS.CVA were evaluated with the system. The results indicated that (1) the system can compare different fMRI processing pipelines with heterogeneous models (NPAIRS.GLM, NPAIRS.CVA and FSL.FEAT) and rank their performance by automatic performance scoring, and (2) the rank of pipeline performance is highly dependent on the preprocessing operations. These results suggest that the system will be of value for the comparison, validation, standardization and optimization of functional neuroimaging software packages and fMRI processing pipelines.","Jing Zhang, Lichen Liang, ...

Dynamics and bifurcations of the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model,/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0267-4,"Recently, several two-dimensional spiking neuron models have been introduced, with the aim of reproducing the diversity of electrophysiological features displayed by real neurons while keeping a simple model, for simulation and analysis purposes. Among these models, the adaptive integrate-and-fire model is physiologically relevant in that its parameters can be easily related to physiological quantities. The interaction of the differential equations with the reset results in a rich and complex dynamical structure. We relate the subthreshold features of the model to the dynamical properties of the differential system and the spike patterns to the properties of a Poincaré map defined by the sequence of spikes. We find a complex bifurcation structure which has a direct interpretation in terms of spike trains. For some parameter values, spike patterns are chaotic.","Jonathan Touboul, Romain Brette",2008-11-15

Implications of different classes of sensorimotor disturbance for cerebellar-based motor learning models,/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0266-5,"The exact role of the cerebellum in motor control and learning is not yet fully understood. The structure, connectivity and plasticity within cerebellar cortex has been extensively studied, but the patterns of connectivity and interaction with other brain structures, and the computational significance of these patterns, is less well known and a matter of debate. Two contrasting models of the role of the cerebellum in motor adaptation have previously been proposed. Most commonly, the cerebellum is employed in a purely feedforward pathway, with its output contributing directly to the outgoing motor command. The cerebellum must then learn an inverse model of the motor apparatus in order to achieve accurate control. More recently, Porrill et al. (Proc Biol Sci 271(1541):789–796, 2004) and Porrill et al. (PLoS Comput Biol 3:1935–1950, 2007a) and Porrill et al. (Neural Comput 19(1), 170–193, 2007b) have highlighted the potential importance of these recurrent connections by proposing an alternative architecture in which the cerebellum is embedded in a recurrent loop with brainstem control circuitry. In this framework, the feedforward connections are not necessary at all. The cerebellum must learn a forward model of the motor apparatus for accurate motor commands to be generated. We show here how these two models exhibit contrasting yet complimentary learning capabilities. Central to the differences in performance between architectures is that there are two distinct kinds of disturbance to which a motor system may need to adapt (1) changes in the relationship between the motor command and the observed outcome and (2) changes in the relationship between the stimulus and the desired outcome. The computational distinction between these two kinds of transformation is subtle and has therefore often been overlooked. However, the implications for learning turn out to be significant: learning with a feedforward architecture is robust following changes in the stimulus-desired outcome mapping but not necessarily the motor command-outcome mapping, while learning with a recurrent architecture is robust under changes in the motor command-outcome mapping but not necessarily the stimulus-desired outcome mapping. We first analyse these differences theoretically and through simulations in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), then illustrate how these same concepts apply more generally with a model of reaching movements.","Adrian Haith, Sethu Vijayakumar",2008-10-22
Working Memory in Schizophrenia: An EEG Study Using Power Spectrum and Coherence Analysis to Estimate Cortical Activation and Network Behavior,/article/10.1007/s10548-008-0062-5,"This study examined regional cortical activations and cortico-cortical connectivity in a group of 20 high-functioning patients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls matched for age and sex during a 0- and a 	2-back working memory (WM) task. An earlier study comparing schizophrenia patients with education level-matched healthy controls revealed less “optimally” organized network during the 2-back task, whereas a second study with healthy volunteers had suggested that the degree of cortical organization may be inversely proportional to educational level (less optimal functional connectivity in better educated individuals interpreted as the result of higher efficiency). In the present study, both groups succeeded in the 2-back WM task although healthy individuals had generally attained a higher level of education. First absolute power spectrum of the different frequency bands corresponding to the electrodes of each lobe was calculated. Then the mean values of coherence were calculated as an index of the average synchronization to construct graphs in order to characterize local and large scale topological patterns of cortico-cortical connectivity. The power spectra analyses showed signs of hypofrontality in schizophrenics with an asymmetry. Additionally, differences between the groups with greater changes during WM in healthy individuals were visible in all lobes more on the left side. The graph parameter results indicated decreased small-world architecture i.e. less optimal cortico-cortical functional organization in patients as compared to controls. These findings are consistent with the notion of aberrant neural organization in schizophrenics which is nevertheless sufficient in supporting adequate task performance.","Ellie Pachou, Michael Vourkas, ...

Phylogenetic Proximity Revealed by Neurodevelopmental Event Timings,/article/10.1007/s12021-008-9013-2,"Statistical properties such as distribution and correlation signatures were investigated using a temporal database of common neurodevelopmental events in the three species most frequently used in experimental studies, rat, mouse, and macaque. There was a fine nexus between phylogenetic proximity and empirically derived dates of the occurrences of 40 common events including the neurogenesis of cortical layers and outgrowth milestones of developing axonal projections. Exponential and power-law approximations to the distribution of the events reveal strikingly similar decay patterns in rats and mice when compared to macaques. Subsequent hierarchical clustering of the common event timings also captures phylogenetic proximity, an association further supported by multivariate linear regression data. These preliminary results suggest that statistical analyses of the timing of developmental milestones may offer a novel measure of phylogenetic classifications. This may have added pragmatic value in the specific support it offers for the reliability of rat/mouse comparative modeling, as well as in the broader implications for the potential of meta-analyses using databases assembled from the extensive empirical literature.","Radhakrishnan Nagarajan, Barbara Clancy",2008-05-23

The response of cortical neurons to in vivo-like input current: theory and experiment: II. Time-varying and spatially distributed inputs,/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0270-9,"The response of a population of neurons to time-varying synaptic inputs can show a rich phenomenology, hardly predictable from the dynamical properties of the membrane’s inherent time constants. For example, a network of neurons in a state of spontaneous activity can respond significantly more rapidly than each single neuron taken individually. Under the assumption that the statistics of the synaptic input is the same for a population of similarly behaving neurons (mean field approximation), it is possible to greatly simplify the study of neural circuits, both in the case in which the statistics of the input are stationary (reviewed in La Camera et al. in Biol Cybern, 2008) and in the case in which they are time varying and unevenly distributed over the dendritic tree. Here, we review theoretical and experimental results on the single-neuron properties that are relevant for the dynamical collective behavior of a population of neurons. We focus on the response of integrate-and-fire neurons and real cortical neurons to long-lasting, noisy, in vivo-like stationary inputs and show how the theory can predict the observed rhythmic activity of cultures of neurons. We then show how cortical neurons adapt on multiple time scales in response to input with stationary statistics in vitro. Next, we review how it is possible to study the general response properties of a neural circuit to time-varying inputs by estimating the response of single neurons to noisy sinusoidal currents. Finally, we address the dendrite–soma interactions in cortical neurons leading to gain modulation and spike bursts, and show how these effects can be captured by a two-compartment integrate-and-fire neuron. Most of the experimental results reviewed in this article have been successfully reproduced by simple integrate-and-fire model neurons.","Michele Giugliano, Giancarlo La Camera, ...

The task dependent interaction of the deactivation regions,/article/10.1007/s11434-008-0222-8,"Although deactivation has been found frequently in former functional brain imaging researches, only recently has it become a focus of systematic study because of its not well understood physiological mechanism. However, most of the researches concentrated on the brain areas that would present deactivation, and, to our knowledge, the deactivation connectivity between these brain areas during the cognitive tasks has rarely been reported in literature. In this work, using the functional connectivity method WICA (within-condition interregional covariance analysis), we analyzed the deactivations in two different cognitive tasks—symbol orientation and number comparison. The results revealed deactivations in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex in both tasks. However, the interaction between the deactivated regions shows many differences. Our result further indicates that the potential implication of special deactivation connectivity may be related to the different task or attention resource. Further research is needed to clarify the exact reason.","Ye Zhang, ShiGang Feng, ... YiYuan Tang",2008-05-01
Evolving coordinated group behaviours through maximisation of mean mutual information,/article/10.1007/s11721-008-0017-1,"A well known problem in the design of the control system for a swarm of robots concerns the definition of suitable individual rules that result in the desired coordinated behaviour. A possible solution to this problem is given by the automatic synthesis of the individual controllers through evolutionary or learning processes. These processes offer the possibility to freely search the space of the possible solutions for a given task, under the guidance of a user-defined utility function. Nonetheless, there exist no general principles to follow in the definition of such a utility function in order to reward coordinated group behaviours. As a consequence, task dependent functions must be devised each time a new coordination problem is under study. In this paper, we propose the use of measures developed in Information Theory as task-independent, implicit utility functions. We present two experiments in which three robots are trained to produce generic coordinated behaviours. Each robot is provided with rich sensory and motor apparatus, which can be exploited to explore the environment and to communicate with other robots. We show how coordinated behaviours can be synthesised through a simple evolutionary process. The only criteria used to evaluate the performance of the robotic group is the estimate of mutual information between the motor states of the robots.","Valerio Sperati, Vito Trianni, Stefano Nolfi",2008-09-17

However, it does not allow for discontinuity which typically arises in real-world reinforcement learning tasks.

Representing an Object by Interchanging What with Where,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2008.1686.1,"Exploring representations is a fundamental step towards understanding vision. The visual system carries two types of information along separate pathways: One is about what it is and the other is about where it is. Initially, the what is represented by a pattern of activity that is distributed across millions of photoreceptors, whereas the where is 'implicitly' given as their retinotopic positions. Many computational theories of object recognition rely on such pixel-based representations, but they are insufficient to learn spatial information such as position and size due to the implicit encoding of the where information. Here we try transforming a retinal image of an object into its internal image via interchanging the what with the where, which means that patterns of intensity in internal image describe the spatial information rather than the object information. To be concrete, the retinal image of an object is deformed and turned over into a negative image, in which light areas appear dark and vice versa, and the object's spatial information is quantified with levels of intensity on borders of that image. Interestingly, the inner part excluding the borders of the internal image shows the position and scale invariance. In order to further understand how the internal image associates the what and where, we examined the internal image of a face which moves or is scaled on the retina. As a result, we found that the internal images form a linear vector space under the object translation and scaling. In conclusion, these results show that the what-where interchangeability might play an important role for organizing those two into internal representation of brain.","Jong-Hoon Ahn, Yillbyung Lee",2008-03-14

The response of cortical neurons to in vivo-like input current: theory and experiment,/article/10.1007/s00422-008-0272-7,"The study of several aspects of the collective dynamics of interacting neurons can be highly simplified if one assumes that the statistics of the synaptic input is the same for a large population of similarly behaving neurons (mean field approach). In particular, under such an assumption, it is possible to determine and study all the equilibrium points of the network dynamics when the neuronal response to noisy, in vivo-like, synaptic currents is known. The response function can be computed analytically for simple integrate-and-fire neuron models and it can be measured directly in experiments in vitro. Here we review theoretical and experimental results about the neural response to noisy inputs with stationary statistics. These response functions are important to characterize the collective neural dynamics that are proposed to be the neural substrate of working memory, decision making and other cognitive functions. Applications to the case of time-varying inputs are reviewed in a companion paper (Giugliano et al. in Biol Cybern, 2008). We conclude that modified integrate-and-fire neuron models are good enough to reproduce faithfully many of the relevant dynamical aspects of the neuronal response measured in experiments on real neurons in vitro.","Giancarlo La Camera, Michele Giugliano, ...

A new paradigm for real-time parallel storage and recognition of patterns based on a hierarchical organization of associative memories utilizing Walsh function encoding,/article/10.1007/s10489-008-0128-9,"A new hierarchical Walsh memory which can store and quickly recognize any number of patterns is proposed. A Walsh function based associative memory was found to be capable of storing and recognizing patterns in parallel via purely a software algorithmic technique (namely, without resorting to parallel hardware) while the memory itself only takes a single pattern space of computer memory, due to the Walsh encoding of each pattern. This type of distributed associative memory lends itself to high speed pattern recognition and has been reported earlier in a single memory version. In this paper, the single memory concept has first been extended to a parallel memory module and then to a tree-shaped hierarchy of these parallel modules that are capable of storing and recognizing any number of patterns for practical large scale data applications exemplified by image and speech recognition.","Seong-Joo Han, Se-Young Oh",2008-05-08

Data Sharing for Computational Neuroscience,/article/10.1007/s12021-008-9009-y,"Computational neuroscience is a subfield of neuroscience that develops models to integrate complex experimental data in order to understand brain function. To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data. Much of those data are not readily accessible because neuroscientists fall into separate communities that study the brain at different levels and have not been motivated to provide data to researchers outside their community. To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations.

Predictive information and explorative behavior of autonomous robots,/article/10.1140/epjb/e2008-00175-0,"Measures of complexity are of immediate interest for the field of autonomous
robots both as a means to classify the behavior and as an objective function
for the autonomous development of robot behavior. In the present paper we
consider predictive information in sensor space as a measure for the
behavioral complexity of a two-wheel embodied robot moving in a rectangular
arena with several obstacles. The mutual information (MI) between past and
future sensor values is found empirically to have a maximum for a behavior
which is both explorative and sensitive to the environment. This makes
predictive information a prospective candidate as an objective function for
the autonomous development of such behaviors. We derive theoretical
expressions for the MI in order to obtain an explicit update rule for the
gradient ascent dynamics. Interestingly, in the case of a linear or
linearized model of the sensorimotor dynamics the structure of the learning
rule derived depends only on the dynamical properties while the value of the
MI influences only the learning rate. In this way the problem of the
prohibitively large sampling times for information theoretic measures can be
circumvented. This result can be generalized and may help to derive explicit
learning rules from complexity theoretic measures.","N. Ay, N. Bertschinger, ... E. Olbrich",2008-04-24
Sound pressure minimization by adjusting the active source parameters with the use of a hybrid genetic algorithm,/article/10.1134/S1063771007060139,Results of computer experiments on the propagation and interaction of sound waves with the aim to minimize the sound pressure in a given zone of a rectangular region are presented. The sound pressure is minimized by the active action of additional sound sources positioned within the region of computation. The optimum parameters of active sources and their positions are determined by solving the minimization problem for the integral functional that expresses the average sound pressure in the given zone of the rectangular region. The problem is solved using a hybrid genetic algorithm.,"V. D. Koshur, M. S. Fadeeva",2007-11-01

Integrated parallel performance views,/article/10.1007/s10586-007-0051-6,"The influences of the operating system and system-specific effects on application performance are increasingly important considerations in high performance computing. OS kernel measurement is key to understanding the performance influences and the interrelationship of system and user-level performance factors. The KTAU (Kernel TAU) methodology and Linux-based framework provides parallel kernel performance measurement from both a kernel-wide and process-centric perspective. The first characterizes overall aggregate kernel performance for the entire system. The second characterizes kernel performance when it runs in the context of a particular process. KTAU extends the TAU performance system with kernel-level monitoring, while leveraging TAU’s measurement and analysis capabilities.

Novel application of principal component analysis to understanding visual cortical development,/article/10.1186/1471-2202-8-S2-P188,"Visual experience has a profound effect on cortical development and function. Monocular deprivation early in life leads to anatomical and physiological changes in visual cortex that result in poor visual acuity in the deprived eye. Multiple mechanisms mediate this synaptic plasticity in developing visual cortex, including excitatory (NMDA, AMPA) and inhibitory (GABAA) receptors and their subunit composition. However, as the number of mechanisms under consideration increases beyond 2 or 3, it becomes difficult to understand the multidimensional nature of the data and to identify the significant combinations and interactions. We overcame this complexity by applying Principal Components Analysis.","David G Jones, Brett R Beston, Kathryn M Murphy",2007-07-06
A new module for on-line manipulation and display of molecular information in the brain architecture management system,/article/10.1385/NI:4:4:275,"A new “Molecules” module of the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS; http://brancusi.usc.edu/bkms) is described. With this module, BAMS becomes the first online know ledge management system to handle central nervous system (CNS) region and celltype chemoarchitectonic data in the context of axonal connections between regions and cell types, in multiple species. The “Molecules” module implements a general knowledge representation schema for data and metadata collated from published and unpublished material, and allows insertion of complex reports about the presence of molecules collated from the literature. For different CNS neural regions and cell types the module's database structure includes representation of molecule expression revealed by various techniques including in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, molecule coexpression and time-dependent level changes, and physiological state of subjects. The metadata representation allows online comparison and evaluation of inserted experiments, and “Molecules” structure allows rapid development of data transfer protocols enabling neuroinformatics visualization tools to display gene expression patterns residing in BAMS, in terms of levels of expressed molecules and in situ hybridization data. The module's web interface allows users to construct lists of CNS regions containing a molecule (depending on physiological state), retrieve further details about inserted records, compare time-dependent data within and across experiments, reconstruct gene expression patterns and construct complex reports from individual experiments.","Mihail Bota, Larry W.

Temporal precision in the neural code and the timescales of natural vision,/article/10.1038/nature06105,"The timing of action potentials relative to sensory stimuli can be precise down to milliseconds in the visual system1,2,3,4,5,6,7, even though the relevant timescales of natural vision are much slower. The existence of such precision contributes to a fundamental debate over the basis of the neural code and, specifically, what timescales are important for neural computation8,9,10. Using recordings in the lateral geniculate nucleus, here we demonstrate that the relevant timescale of neuronal spike trains depends on the frequency content of the visual stimulus, and that ‘relative’, not absolute, precision is maintained both during spatially uniform white-noise visual stimuli and naturalistic movies. Using information-theoretic techniques, we demonstrate a clear role of relative precision, and show that the experimentally observed temporal structure in the neuronal response is necessary to represent accurately the more slowly changing visual world. By establishing a functional role of precision, we link visual neuron function on slow timescales to temporal structure in the response at faster timescales, and uncover a straightforward purpose of fine-timescale features of neuronal spike trains.","Daniel A.

"The Influence of Cognitive Tasks on Different Frequencies 
Steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials",/article/10.1007/s10548-007-0035-0,"Previous studies suggested that there exists different neural networks for different frequency bands of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). What is the effect of the same cognitive task on different frequency SSVEPs? In this work, when a subject was conducting a graded memory task, a 8.3 or 20 Hz flicker was used as a background stimulation. The recorded EEGs were analyzed by the method of steady-state probe topography (SSPT), the results showed that SSVEPs under these two flicker conditions were similar to each other in the various stages of memory process, and were similar to the result of a high alpha band SSVEP as reported before. However, the SSVEP amplitude and latency in the lower frequency band is more clear and stable than that in the higher frequency band. These results suggest that the same cognitive task affects the different frequency SSVEP in a similar way, and the low frequency flicker is a better choice than the high frequency one in such as working memory study.","Zhenghua Wu, Dezhong Yao",2007-10-12
The Open-Source Neuroimaging Research Enterprise,/article/10.1007/s10278-007-9066-z,"While brain imaging in the clinical setting is largely a practice of looking at images, research neuroimaging is a quantitative and integrative enterprise. Images are run through complex batteries of processing and analysis routines to generate numeric measures of brain characteristics. Other measures potentially related to brain function – demographics, genetics, behavioral tests, neuropsychological tests – are key components of most research studies. The canonical scanner – PACS – viewing station axis used in clinical practice is therefore inadequate for supporting neuroimaging research. Here, we model the neuroimaging research enterprise as a workflow. The principal components of the workflow include data acquisition, data archiving, data processing and analysis, and data utilization. We also describe a set of open-source applications to support each step of the workflow and the transitions between these steps. These applications include DIGITAL IMAGING AND COMMUNICATIONS IN MEDICINE viewing and storage tools, the EXTENSIBLE NEUROIMAGING ARCHIVE TOOLKIT data archiving and exploration platform, and an engine for running processing/analysis pipelines.

Successes and Rewards in Sharing Digital Reconstructions of Neuronal Morphology,/article/10.1007/s12021-007-0010-7,"The computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction of neuronal morphology is becoming an increasingly popular technique to quantify the arborization patterns of dendrites and axons. The resulting digital files are suitable for comprehensive morphometric analyses as well as for building anatomically realistic compartmental models of membrane biophysics and neuronal electrophysiology. The digital tracings acquired in a lab for a specific purpose can be often re-used by a different research group to address a completely unrelated scientific question, if the original investigators are willing to share the data. Since reconstructing neuronal morphology is a labor-intensive process, data sharing and re-analysis is particularly advantageous for the neuroscience and biomedical communities. Here we present numerous cases of “success stories” in which digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology were shared and re-used, leading to additional, independent discoveries and publications, and thus amplifying the impact of the “source” study for which the data set was first collected. In particular, we overview four main applications of this kind of data: comparative morphometric analyses, statistical estimation of potential synaptic connectivity, morphologically accurate electrophysiological simulations, and computational models of neuronal shape and development.",Giorgio A.

Toward a workbench for rodent brain image data systems architecture and design,/article/10.1385/NI:5:1:35,"We present a novel system for storing and manipulating microscopic images from sections through the brain and higher-level data extracted from such images. The system is designed and built on a three-tier paradigm and provides the research community with a web-based interface for facile use in neuroscience research. The Oracle relational database management system provides the ability to store a variety of objects relevant to the images and provides the framework for complex querying of data stored in the system. Further, the suite of applications intimately tied into the infrastructure in the application layer provide the user the ability not only to query and visualize the data, but also to perform analysis operations based on the tools embedded into the system.

The system is extensible to other circuits and projections and to other categories of image data and provides a unique environment for analysis of rodent brain maps in the context of anatomical data. The FACCS application assumes standard animal brain atlas models and can be extended to future models.

Mapping the Human Brain: New Insights from fMRI Data Sharing,/article/10.1007/s12021-007-0011-6,"The sharing of primary data in the field of neuroscience has received considerable scrutiny from scientific societies and from science journals. Many see this as value added for science publishing that can enhance and inform secondary examination of data and results. Still others worry that data sharing is an undue burden for researchers with little long term value to science. But examples of how data sharing can be done successfully do exist. The fMRI Data Center, established at Dartmouth College in 2000 and now based at the University of California Santa Barbara, has worked to facilitate the open sharing of neuroimaging data from peer-reviewed papers to foster progress in cognitive science. The fMRI study on the representation of objects in the human occipital and temporal cortex, published in 2000 in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (JOCN), marked the first deposition in the new database. Despite initial concerns about fMRI data sharing, this data set was frequently downloaded. We describe the original results of distributed brain activation patterns elicited by faces and objects in the human visual system, and overview several secondary analyses by independent investigators. A philosopher tested Husserl’s temporal components of consciousness, whereas other brain imagers deployed new analytic tools, from Dynamic Causal Modeling, which estimates the neural interactions between cortical regions, to a novel method for constructing reproducibility maps. These re-analyses revealed new findings not reported in the original study, provided new perspectives on visual perception, generated new predictions, and resulted in new collaborations and publications in high profile journals.","John Darrell Van Horn, Alumit Ishai",2007-08-18

The second is addressed by transparently recording metadata describing all aspects of the batch job e.g., subject demographics, analysis parameters, locations and names of created files, date and time of analysis, and so on). These metadata are recorded as instances of an extended version of the Protégé-based Experiment Lab Book ontology created by the Dartmouth fMRI Data Center. The resulting instantiated ontology provides a detailed record of all fMRI analyses performed, and as such can be part of larger systems for neuroimaging data management, sharing, and visualization.

The coexisting systems of normally placed and displaced amacrine cells in the vertebrate retina provide interesting examples of retinotopic spatial organization. However, it is not clear whether these two systems are spatially interrelated or not. The current work applies two mathematical-computational methods-a new method involving Voronoi diagrams for local density quantification and a more traditional approach, the Ripley K function-in order to characterize the mosaics of normally placed and displaced amacrine cells in the retina of Hoplias malabaricus and search for possible spatial relationships between these two types of mosaics.

The site, based on a statistical model that has evolved over the past decade, currently incorporates 102 different neurodevelopmental events obtained from 10 species: hamsters, mice, rats, rabbits, spiny mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, cats, rhesus monkeys, and humans. Data are arranged in a Structured Query Language database, which allows comparative brain development measured in postconception days to be converted and accessed in real time, using Hypertext Preprocessor language. Algorithms applied to the database also allow predictions for dates of specific neurodevelopmental events where empirical data are not available, including for the human embryo and fetus. By designing a web-based portal, we seek to make these comparative data readily available to all those who need to efficiently estimate the timing of neurodevelopmental events in the human fetus, laboratory species, or across several different species. In an effort to further refine and expand the applicability of this database, we include a mechanism to submit additional data.","Barbara Clancy, Brandon Kersh, ... Barbara L. Finlay",2007-03-01

Interoperability of Neuroscience Modeling Software: Current Status and Future Directions,/article/10.1007/s12021-007-0004-5,"Neuroscience increasingly uses computational models to assist in the exploration and interpretation of complex phenomena. As a result, considerable effort is invested in the development of software tools and technologies for numerical simulations and for the creation and publication of models.

Development practices and technologies that support interoperability between software systems therefore play an important role in making the modeling process more efficient and in ensuring that published models can be reliably and easily reused. Various forms of interoperability are possible including the development of portable model description standards, the adoption of common simulation languages or the use of standardized middleware.

The high-frequency part (>750 Hz) of the potentials (multi-unit activity, MUA) is found to scale approximately as the population firing rate to the power 3/4 and to give excellent estimates of the underlying population firing rate for trial-averaged data. The MUA signal is found to decay much more sharply outside the columnar populations than the LFP.","Klas H. Pettersen, Espen Hagen, Gaute T. Einevoll",2007-10-10
Modulation of synchrony without changes in firing rates,/article/10.1007/s11571-007-9017-x,"It was often reported and suggested that the synchronization of spikes can occur without changes in the firing rate. However, few theoretical studies have tested its mechanistic validity. In the present study, we investigate whether changes in synaptic weights can induce an independent modulation of synchrony while the firing rate remains constant. We study this question at the level of both single neurons and neuronal populations using network simulations of conductance based integrate-and-fire neurons. The network consists of a single layer that includes local excitatory and inhibitory recurrent connections, as well as long-range excitatory projections targeting both classes of neurons. Each neuron in the network receives external input consisting of uncorrelated Poisson spike trains. We find that increasing this external input leads to a linear increase of activity in the network, as well␣as an increase in the peak frequency of oscillation. In␣contrast, balanced changes of the synaptic weight of␣excitatory long-range projections for both classes of postsynaptic neurons modulate the degree of synchronization without altering the firing rate. These results demonstrate that, in a simple network, synchronization and firing rate can be modulated independently, and thus, may be used as independent coding dimensions.","Jakob Heinzle, Peter König, Rodrigo F.

Feature Fusion for the Detection of Microsleep Events,/article/10.1007/s11265-007-0083-4,"A combination of linear and nonlinear methods for feature fusion is introduced and the performance of this methodology is illustrated on a real-world problem: the detection of sudden and non-anticipated lapses of attention in car drivers due to drowsiness. To achieve this, signals coming from heterogeneous sources are processed, namely the brain electric activity, variation in the pupil size, and eye and eyelid movements. For all the signals considered, the features are extracted both in the spectral domain and in state space. Linear features are obtained by the modified periodogram, whereas the nonlinear features are based on the recently introduced method of delay vector variance (DVV). The decision process based on such fused features is achieved by support vector machines (SVM) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural networks. For the latter also methods of metrics adaptation in the input space are applied. The parameters of all utilized algorithms are optimized empirically in order to gain maximal classification accuracy. It is also shown that metrics adaptation by weighting the input features can improve the classification accuracy, but only to a limited extent. Limited improvements are also obtained when fusing features of selected signals, but highest improvements are gained by fusion of features of all available signals. In this case test errors are reduced down to 9% in the mean, which clearly illustrates the potential of our methodology to establish a reference standard of drowsiness and microsleep detection devices for future online driver monitoring.","Martin Golz, David Sommer, ...

Integral equation methods for computing likelihoods and their derivatives in the stochastic integrate-and-fire model,/article/10.1007/s10827-007-0042-x,"We recently introduced likelihood-based methods for fitting stochastic integrate-and-fire models to spike train data. The key component of this method involves the likelihood that the model will emit a spike at a given time t. Computing this likelihood is equivalent to computing a Markov first passage time density (the probability that the model voltage crosses threshold for the first time at time t). Here we detail an improved method for computing this likelihood, based on solving a certain integral equation. This integral equation method has several advantages over the techniques discussed in our previous work: in particular, the new method has fewer free parameters and is easily differentiable (for gradient computations). The new method is also easily adaptable for the case in which the model conductance, not just the input current, is time-varying. Finally, we describe how to incorporate large deviations approximations to very small likelihoods.","Liam Paninski, Adrian Haith, Gabor Szirtes",2007-05-10

OdorMapComparer: An Application for Quantitative Analyses and Comparisons of fMRI Brain Odor Maps,/article/10.1007/s12021-007-0002-7,"Brain odor maps are reconstructed flat images that describe the spatial activity patterns in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulbs in animals exposed to different odor stimuli. We have developed a software application, OdorMapComparer, to carry out quantitative analyses and comparisons of the fMRI odor maps. This application is an open-source window program that first loads two odor map images being compared. It allows image transformations including scaling, flipping, rotating, and warping so that the two images can be appropriately aligned to each other. It performs simple subtraction, addition, and average of signals in the two images. It also provides comparative statistics including the normalized correlation (NC) and spatial correlation coefficient. Experimental studies showed that the rodent fMRI odor maps for aliphatic aldehydes displayed spatial activity patterns that are similar in gross outlines but somewhat different in specific subregions. Analyses with OdorMapComparer indicate that the similarity between odor maps decreases with increasing difference in the length of carbon chains. For example, the map of butanal is more closely related to that of pentanal (with a NC = 0.617) than to that of octanal (NC = 0.082), which is consistent with animal behavioral studies. The study also indicates that fMRI odor maps are statistically odor-specific and repeatable across both the intra- and intersubject trials. OdorMapComparer thus provides a tool for quantitative, statistical analyses and comparisons of fMRI odor maps in a fashion that is integrated with the overall odor mapping techniques.","Nian Liu, Fuqiang Xu, ...

Model-based variational smoothing and segmentation for diffusion tensor imaging in the brain,/article/10.1385/NI:4:3:217,"This article applies a unified approach to variational smoothing and segmentation to brain diffusion tensor image data along user-selected attributes derived from the tensor, with the aim of extracting detailed brain structure information. The application of this framework simultaneously segments and denoises to produce edges and smoothed regions within the white matter of the brain that are relatively homogeneous with respect to the diffusion tensor attributes of choice. This approach enables the visualization of a smoothed, scale invariant representation of the tensor data field in a variety of diverse forms. In addition to known attributes such as fractional anisotropy, these representations include selected directional tensor components and additionally associated continuous valued edge fields that might be used for further segmentation. A comparison is presented of the results of three different data model selections with respect to their ability to resolve white matter structure. The resulting images are integrated to provide better perspective of the model properties (edges, smoothed image, and so forth) and their relationship to the underlying brain anatomy. The improvement in brain image quality is illustrated both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the robust performance of the algorithm in the presence of added noise is shown. Smoothing occurs without loss of edge features because of the simultaneous segmentation aspect of the variational approach, and the output enables better delineation of tensors representative of local and long-range association, projection, and commissural fiber systems.","Mukund Desai, David N.

Statistical atlas of acute stroke from magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted-images of the brain,/article/10.1385/NI:4:3:235,"This study presents a method for computing a probabilistic atlas that describes the spatial distributions of acute infarcts of the brain. The data consisted of diffusion-weighted-images (DWI) and high-resolution T1-weighted MR images rep resenting ww studies from 22 subjects. All DWI data sets contained high-intensity lesions on B-1000 maps, known from clinical history to be related to acute stroke. To compute the atlas, manually segmented infarcts on original DWI were spatially transformed and registered to a common coordinate system. This coordinate system allowed combining all lesions into a statistical atlas in the model space. As a result, the computed probabilistic map showed mild left-sided predominance of brain infarcts, which likely represents asymmetry in eloquence of brain regions. In our opinion, the statistical atlas of acute brain infarcts can facilitate computer-based detection of stroke in large image data sets.","Michel Bilello, Zhiqiang Lao, ... Edward H.

No-Reference image quality metrics for structural MRI,/article/10.1385/NI:4:3:243,"Neuroimagery must be visually checked for unacceptable levels of distortion prior to processing. However, inspection is time-consuming, unreliable for detecting subtle distortions and often subjective. With the increasing volume of neuroimagery, objective measures of quality are needed in order to automate screening. To address this need, we have assessed the effectiveness of no-reference image quality measures, which quantify quality inherent to a single image. A data set of 1001 magnetic resonance images (MRIs) recorded from 143 subjects was used for this evaluation. The MRI images were artificially distorted with two levels of either additive Gaussian noise or intensity nouniformity created from a linear model. A total of 239 different quality measures were defined from seven overall families and used to discriminate images for the type and level of distortion. Analysis of Variance identified two families of quality measure that were most effective: one based on Natural Scene Statistics and one originally developed to measure distortion caused by image compression. Measures from both families reliably discriminated among undistorted images, noisy images, and images distorted by intensity nonuniformity. The best quality measures were sensitive only to the distortion category and were not significantly affected by other factors. The results are encouraging enough that several quality measures are being incorporated in a real world MRI test bed.","Jeffrey P. Woodard, Monica P. Carley-Spencer",2006-09-01

Cross-intensity functions and the estimate of spike-time jitter,/article/10.1007/s00422-007-0143-7,"Correlation measures are important tools for the analysis of simultaneously recorded spike trains. A well-known measure with probabilistic interpretation is the cross-intensity function (CIF), which is an estimate of the conditional probability that a neuron spikes as a function of the time lag to spikes in another neuron. The non-commutative nature of the CIF is particularly useful when different neuron classes are studied that can be distinguished based on their anatomy or physiology. Here we explore the utility of the CIF for estimating spike-time jitter in synaptic interactions between neuron pairs of connected classes. When applied to spike train pairs from sleeping songbirds, we are able to distinguish fast synaptic interactions mediated primarily by AMPA receptors from slower interactions mediated by NMDA receptors. We also find that spike jitter increases with the time lag between spikes, reflecting the accumulation of noise in neural activity sequences, such as in synfire chains. In conclusion, we demonstrate some new utility of the CIF as a spike-train measure.",Richard H. R. Hahnloser,2007-03-27
Fluctuations in Neuronal Synchronization in Brain Activity Correlate with the Subjective Experience of Visual Recognition,/article/10.1007/s10867-007-9041-4,"The scientific study of subjective experience is a current major research area in the neurosciences. Coordination patterns of brain activity are being studied to address the question of how brain function relates to behaviour, and particularly methods to estimate neuronal synchronization can unravel the spatio-temporal dynamics of the transient formation of neuronal assemblies. We report here a biophysical correlate of subjective experience. Subjects visualised figures with different levels of noise, while their brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG), and reported the moment in time (corresponding to a noise level) of figure recognition, which varied between individuals, as well as the moment when they saw the figure more clearly, which was mostly common among the participants (thus less subjective). This latter moment is considered to represent psychophysical stochastic resonance (PSR). Fluctuations in neuronal synchronization, quantified using a diffusion coefficient, were lower in occipital cortex when subjects recognised the figure, for a certain noise level, but did not correlate with the moment of PSR. A different pattern was observed in frontal cortex, where lower values of the diffusion coefficient in neuronal synchronization was maintained from the moment of recognition to the moment of PSR. No specific pattern was found analysing signals from temporal or parietal cortical areas. These observations provide support for distinct synchronization patterns in different cortical areas, and represent another demonstration that the subjective, first-person perspective is accessible to scientific methods.","Jose Luis Perez Velazquez, Luis Garcia Dominguez, Ramon Guevara Erra",2007-02-01
Adaptive behavior in turning of an oscillator-driven biped robot,/article/10.1007/s10514-007-9029-8,"This paper concentrates on a biped robot’s turning behavior that consists of straight and curved walking and the transition between these two patterns. We investigate how a robot achieves adaptive walking during such turning by focusing on rhythm control and propose a locomotion control system that generates robot motions by rhythmic signals from internal oscillators and modulates signal generation based on touch sensor signals. First, we verify that the robot attains limit cycles of straight and curved walking by numerical simulations and hardware experiments. Second, we examine the transition between these walking patterns based on the basin of attraction of the limit cycles in numerical simulations. Finally, we verify whether the robot actually accomplishes transition and turning by hardware experiments. This paper clarifies that the robot establishes such turning motions by adequate modulation of walking rhythm and phase through interactions between the dynamics of its mechanical system, oscillators, and environment.","Shinya Aoi, Kazuo Tsuchiya",2007-05-10

Three dimensional digital atlas of the orbit constructed from multi-modal radiological images,/article/10.1007/s11548-006-0063-3,"The human orbit has numerous structures packed in a relatively small space, the study of which is essential and difficult due to complex three dimensional relationships. Available printed orbital atlases do not convey the three dimensional information and are not interactive. To overcome these limitations, we built a digital 3D orbital atlas presented in axial, coronal and sagittal planes, and as three dimensional geometric models of the muscles, bones, and eyeball. The bone models are from a CT scan, the muscle and optic nerve from a MR scan, and other components that cannot be distinguished radiologically are modeled as geometric primitives from anatomic literature. All multi-modal data including the models and images are registered into the same space to form a complete atlas. All structures in the atlas are labeled with their names. An atlas browser is developed for user-friendly manipulation and presentation of the atlas content. Each structure can be turned on or off, rotated, zoomed, or moved, either individually or in unison with other selected structures. Thus, the relationships between different structures can be studied in greater depth. The method developed to build the orbital atlas is general and can be used to create other atlases or to build patient specific geometric models. The orbital atlas may be used for studying the orbital anatomy, as a reference guide for practitioners, and as a base for simulation of orbital surgery.","Jimin Liu, Su Huang, ... Wieslaw L.

Extracting Information from Cortical Connectivity Patterns Estimated from High Resolution EEG Recordings: A Theoretical Graph Approach,/article/10.1007/s10548-007-0019-0,"Over the last 20 years, a body of techniques known as high resolution EEG has allowed precise estimation of cortical activity from non-invasive EEG measurements. The availability of cortical waveforms from non-invasive EEG recordings allows to have not only the level of activation within a single region of interest (ROI) during a particular task, but also to estimate the causal relationships among activities of several cortical regions. However, interpreting resulting connectivity patterns is still an open issue, due to the difficulty to provide an objective measure of their properties across different subjects or groups. A novel approach addressed to solve this difficulty consists in manipulating these functional brain networks as graph objects for which a large body of indexes and tools are available in literature and already tested for complex networks at different levels of scale (Social, WorldWideWeb and Proteomics). In the present work, we would like to show the suitability of such approach, showing results obtained comparing separately two groups of subjects during the same motor task and two different motor tasks performed by the same group. In the first experiment two groups of subjects (healthy and spinal cord injured patients) were compared when they moved and attempted to move simultaneously their right foot and lips, respectively. The contrast between the foot–lips movement and the simple foot movement was addressed in the second experiment for the population of the healthy subjects. For both the experiments, the main question is whether the “architecture” of the functional connectivity networks obtained could show properties that are different in the two groups or in the two tasks. All the functional connectivity networks gathered in the two experiments showed ordered properties and significant differences from “random” networks having the same characteristic sizes. The proposed approach, based on the use of indexes derived from graph theory, can apply to cerebral connectivity patterns estimated not only from the EEG signals but also from different brain imaging methods.","Fabrizio De Vico Fallani, Laura Astolfi, ...

To address this need, we have developed and extensible markup language (XML) schema and associated tools for the storage of neuro-imaging activation maps and anatomical labels. This schema, as part of the XML-based Clinical Experiment Data Exchange (XCEDE) schema, provides storage capabilities for analysis annotations, activation threshold parameters, and cluster and voxel-level statistics. Activation parameters contain information describing the threshold, degrees of freedom, FWHM smoothness, search volumes voxel sizes, expected voxels per cluster, and expected number of clusters in the statistical map. Cluster and voxel statistics can be stored along with the coordinates, threshold, and anatomical label information. Multiple threshold types can be documented for a given cluster or voxel along with the uncorrected and corrected probability values.

A hybrid approach to shape-based interpolation of stereotactic atlases of the human brain,/article/10.1385/NI:4:2:177,"Stereotactic human brain atlases, either in print or electronic form, are useful not only in functional neurosurgery, but also in neuroradiology, human brain mapping, and neuroscience education. The existing atlases represent structures on 2D plates taken at variable, often large intervals, which limit their applications. To overcome this problem, we propose ahybrid interpolation approach to build high-resolution brain atlases from the existing ones. In this approach, all section regions of each object are grouped into two types of components: simple and complex. A NURBS-based method is designed for interpolation of the simple components, and a distance map-based method for the complex components. Once all individual objects in the atlas are interpolated, the results are combined hierarchically in a bottom-up manner to produce the interpolation of the entire atlas. In the procedure, different knowledge-based and heuristic strategies are used to preserve various topological relationships. The proposed approach has been validated quantitatively and used for interpolation of two stereotactic brain atlases: the Talairach-Tournouxatlas and Schaltenbrand-Wahren atlas. The interpolations produced are of high resolution and feature high accuracy, 3D consistency, smooth surface, and preserved topology. They potentially open new applications for electronic stereotactic brain atlases, such as atlas reformatting, accurate 3D display, and 3D nonlinear warping against normal and pathological scans. The proposed approach is also potentially useful in other applications, which require interpolation and 3D modeling from sparse and/or variable intersection interval data. An example of 3D modeling of an infarct from MR diffusion images is presented.","Jimin Liu, Wieslaw L. Nowinski",2006-06-01

A New Method of Spatio-Temporal Topographic Mapping by Correlation Coefficient of K-means Cluster,/article/10.1007/s10548-006-0017-7,"It would be of the utmost interest to map correlated sources in the working human brain by Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). This work is to develop a new method to map correlated neural sources based on the time courses of the scalp ERPs waveforms. The ERP data are classified first by k-means cluster analysis, and then the Correlation Coefficients (CC) between the original data of each electrode channel and the time course of each cluster centroid are calculated and utilized as the mapping variable on the scalp surface. With a normalized 4-concentric-sphere head model with radius 1, the performance of the method is evaluated by simulated data. CC, between simulated four sources (s
1–s
4) and the estimated cluster centroids (c
1–c
4), and the distances (Ds), between the scalp projection points of the s
1–s
4 and that of the c
1–c
4, are utilized as the evaluation indexes. Applied to four sources with two of them partially correlated (with maximum mutual CC = 0.4892), CC (Ds) between s
1–s
4 and c
1–c
4 are larger (smaller) than 0.893 (0.108) for noise levels NSR≤ 0.2; Applied to four sources with two of them completely correlated, CC (Ds) between s

4 and c
1–c
4 are larger (smaller) than 0.97367 (0.1898) for a random noise level NSR≤ 0.2; Applied to 128, 64 and 32 recording electrodes, CC (Ds) between s
1–s
4 and c
1–c
4 are larger (smaller) than 0.9557 (0.4251) for a random noise level NSR = 0.15; And applied to the cases of spatially overlapped scalp activities, CC (Ds) between s
1–s
4 and c
1–c
4 are larger (smaller) than 0.9083 (0.4329) for a random noise level NSR = 0.15. Finally, the method successfully decomposed the ERPs collected in a spatial selective attention experiment into three clusters located at left, right occipital and frontal. The estimated vectors of the contra-occipital area demonstrate that attention to the stimulus location produces increased amplitude of the P1 and N1 components over the contra-occipital scalp. The estimated vector in the frontal area displays two large processing negativity waves around 100 ms and 250 ms when subjects are attentive, and there is a small negative wave around 140 ms and a P300 when subjects are unattentive. The results of simulations and real Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) data demonstrate the validity of the method in mapping correlated sources. This method may be an objective, heuristic and important tool to study the properties of cerebral, neural networks in cognitive and clinical neurosciences.","Ling Li, Dezhong Yao",2007-01-20
QuakeSim and the Solid Earth Research Virtual Observatory,/article/10.1007/s00024-006-0126-y,"We are developing simulation and analysis tools in order to develop a solid Earth Science framework for understanding and studying active tectonic and earthquake processes. The goal of QuakeSim and its extension, the Solid Earth Research Virtual Observatory (SERVO), is to study the physics of earthquakes using state-of-the-art modeling, data manipulation, and pattern recognition technologies. We are developing clearly defined accessible data formats and code protocols as inputs to simulations, which are adapted to high-performance computers. The solid Earth system is extremely complex and nonlinear, resulting in computationally intensive problems with millions of unknowns. With these tools it will be possible to construct the more complex models and simulations necessary to develop hazard assessment systems critical for reducing future losses from major earthquakes. We are using Web (Grid) service technology to demonstrate the assimilation of multiple distributed data sources (a typical data grid problem) into a major parallel high-performance computing earthquake forecasting code. Such a linkage of Geoinformatics with Geocomplexity demonstrates the value of the Solid Earth Research Virtual Observatory (SERVO) Grid concept, and advances Grid technology by building the first real-time large-scale data assimilation grid.","Andrea Donnellan, John Rundle, ...

Blind Deconvolution in Nonminimum Phase Systems Using Cascade Structure,/article/10.1155/2007/48432,"We introduce a novel cascade demixing structure for multichannel blind deconvolution in nonminimum phase systems. To simplify the learning process, we decompose the demixing model into a causal finite impulse response (FIR) filter and an anticausal scalar FIR filter. A permutable cascade structure is constructed by two subfilters. After discussing geometrical structure of FIR filter manifold, we develop the natural gradient algorithms for both FIR subfilters. Furthermore, we derive the stability conditions of algorithms using the permutable characteristic of the cascade structure. Finally, computer simulations are provided to show good learning performance of the proposed method.","Bin Xia, Liqing Zhang",2006-12-01
Dynamic causal models of neural system dynamics: current state and future extensions,/article/10.1007/s12038-007-0012-5,"Complex processes resulting from interaction of multiple elements can rarely be understood by analytical scientific approaches alone; additional, mathematical models of system dynamics are required. This insight, which disciplines like physics have embraced for a long time already, is gradually gaining importance in the study of cognitive processes by functional neuroimaging. In this field, causal mechanisms in neural systems are described in terms of effective connectivity. Recently, dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was introduced as a generic method to estimate effective connectivity from neuroimaging data in a Bayesian fashion. One of the key advantages of DCM over previous methods is that it distinguishes between neural state equations and modality-specific forward models that translate neural activity into a measured signal. Another strength is its natural relation to Bayesian model selection (BMS) procedures. In this article, we review the conceptual and mathematical basis of DCM and its implementation for functional magnetic resonance imaging data and event-related potentials. After introducing the application of BMS in the context of DCM, we conclude with an outlook to future extensions of DCM. These extensions are guided by the long-term goal of using dynamic system models for pharmacological and clinical applications, particularly with regard to synaptic plasticity.","Klaas E Stephan, Lee M Harrison, ...

An artificial moth: Chemical source localization using a robot based neuronal model of moth optomotor anemotactic search,/article/10.1007/s10514-006-7101-4,"Robots have been used to model nature, while nature in turn can contribute to the real-world artifacts we construct. One particular domain of interest is chemical search where a number of efforts are underway to construct mobile chemical search and localization systems. We report on a project that aims at constructing such a system based on our understanding of the pheromone communication system of the moth. Based on an overview of the peripheral processing of chemical cues by the moth and its role in the organization of behavior we emphasize the multimodal aspects of chemical search, i.e. optomotor anemotactic chemical search. We present a model of this behavior that we test in combination with a novel thin metal oxide sensor and custom build mobile robots. We show that the sensor is able to detect the odor cue, ethanol, under varying flow conditions. Subsequently we show that the standard model of insect chemical search, consisting of a surge and cast phases, provides for robust search and localization performance. The same holds when it is augmented with an optomotor collision avoidance model based on the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) neuron of the locust. We compare our results to others who have used the moth as inspiration for the construction of odor robots.","Pawel Pyk, Sergi Bermúdez i Badia, ... Paul F. M. J. Verschure",2006-06-08
LONI Visualization Environment,/article/10.1007/s10278-006-0266-8,"Over the past decade, the use of informatics to solve complex neuroscientific problems has increased dramatically. Many of these research endeavors involve examining large amounts of imaging, behavioral, genetic, neurobiological, and neuropsychiatric data. Superimposing, processing, visualizing, or interpreting such a complex cohort of datasets frequently becomes a challenge. We developed a new software environment that allows investigators to integrate multimodal imaging data, hierarchical brain ontology systems, on-line genetic and phylogenic databases, and 3D virtual data reconstruction models. The Laboratory of Neuro Imaging visualization environment (LONI Viz) consists of the following components: a sectional viewer for imaging data, an interactive 3D display for surface and volume rendering of imaging data, a brain ontology viewer, and an external database query system. The synchronization of all components according to stereotaxic coordinates, region name, hierarchical ontology, and genetic labels is achieved via a comprehensive BrainMapper functionality, which directly maps between position, structure name, database, and functional connectivity information. This environment is freely available, portable, and extensible, and may prove very useful for neurobiologists, neurogenetisists, brain mappers, and for other clinical, pedagogical, and research endeavors.","Ivo D.

Simulation of networks of spiking neurons: A review of tools and strategies,/article/10.1007/s10827-007-0038-6,"We review different aspects of the simulation of spiking neural networks. We start by reviewing the different types of simulation strategies and algorithms that are currently implemented. We next review the precision of those simulation strategies, in particular in cases where plasticity depends on the exact timing of the spikes. We overview different simulators and simulation environments presently available (restricted to those freely available, open source and documented). For each simulation tool, its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow the reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin–Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models are implemented on the different simulators, and the codes are made available. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide a resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate integration strategy and simulation tool to use for a given modeling problem related to spiking neural networks.","Romain Brette, Michelle Rudolph, ...

The Mechanism of Involuntary Visual Spatial Attention Revealed by a New Linear Computation Model,/article/10.1007/s10548-006-0003-0,"EEG reveals brain electrical activities with high temporal resolution. Yet, multiple implicit variables may be involved in limited event related potential (ERP) measures. Special computation techniques are needed to recover these parameters. In the study of involuntary visual spatial attention, we may obtain the ERP in valid cued (V), invalid cued (I) and neutral cued (N) conditions. Usually, the effect of involuntary attention is computed by the subtraction model with the assumption that V/I and N are independent. Yet, they should be related. Treating V/I as a function of N, a linear model V(I) = W + GN is assumed, where W and G are implicit in the ERP measures. G is the gain control on the neutral function. Provided G and W are constant over a local brain region, we may use the Total Least Square (TLS) algorithm to compute their values. The values of W and G computed from an involuntary attention experiment data show that multiple implicit variables are involved in obtained ERPs. Here G acts as a “top-down” sensory modulator on the neutral ERPs and W is related to possible newly involved neural activities. The parameters derived from the new linear model also suggest that there are different mechanisms involved in involuntary attention and voluntary allocation of attention.","Lijun Qiu, Dezhong Yao, ...

High-resolution large-scale mosaic imaging using multiphoton microscopy to characterize transgenic mouse models of human neurological disorders,/article/10.1385/NI:4:1:65,"The thorough characterization of transgenic mouse models of human central nervous system diseases is a necessary step in realizing the full benefit of using animal models to investigate disease processes and potential therapeutics. Because of the labor- and resource-intensive nature of high-resolution imaging, detailed investigation of possible structural or biochemical alterations in brain sections has typically focused on specific regions of interest as determined by the researcher a priori. For example, Parkinson's disease researchers often focus imaging on regions of the brain expected to exhibit pathology such as the substantia nigra and striatum. Because of limitations in acquiring and storing high-resolution imaging data, additional data contained in the specimen is not usually acquired or disseminated/reported to the research community. Here we present a method of imaging large regions of brain at close to the resolution limit of light microscopy using a mosaic imaging technique in conjunction with multiphoton microscopy. These maps are being used to characterize several genetically modified animal models of neurological disease by filling the information “gap” among techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopic analysis.","Diana L.

Mapping heritability and molecular genetic associations with cortical features using probabilistic brain atlases,/article/10.1385/NI:4:1:5,"There is an urgent need to decipher the complex nature of genotype-phenotype relationships within the multiple dimensions of brain structure and function that are compromised in neuropsychiatric syndromes such as schizophrenia. Doing so requires sophisticated methodologies to represent population variability in neural traits and to probe their heritable and molecular genetic bases. We have recently developed and applied computational algorithms to map the heritability of, as well as genetic linkage and association to, neural features encoded using brain imaging in the context of three-dimensional (3D), population-based, statistical brain atlases. One set of algorithms builds on our prior work using classical twin study methods to estimate heritability by fitting biometrical models for additive genetic, unique, and common environmental influences. Another set of algorithms performs regression-based (Haseman-Elston) identical-bydescent linkage analysis and genetic association analysis of DNA polymorphisms in relation to neural traits of interest in the same 3D population-based brain atlas format. We demonstrate these approaches using samples of healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, as well as MZ and DZ twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia, but the methods can be generalized to other classes of relatives and to other diseases. The results confirm prior evidence of genetic influences on gray matter density in frontal brain regions. They also provide converging evidence that the chromosome 1q42 region is relevant to schizophrenia by demonstrating linkage and association of markers of the Transelin-Associated-Factor-X and Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 genes with prefrontal cortical gray matter deficits in twins discordant for schizophrenia.","Tyrone D.

Dynamic phenotypes,/article/10.1385/NI:4:1:119,"We consider quantitative measures of behavioral and neuronal dynamics as a means of characterizing phenotypes. Such measures are important from a scientific perspective; because understanding brain function is contingent on understanding the link between the dynamics of the nervous system and behavioral dynamics. They are also important from a biomedical perspective because they provide a contrast to purely psychological characterizations of phenotype or characterizations via static brain images or maps, and are a potential means for differential diagnoses of neuropsychiatric illnesses. After a brief presentation of background work and some current advances, we suggest that more attention needs to be paid to dynamic characterizations of phenotypes. We will discuss some of the relevant time series analysis tools.","Hemant Bokil, Ofer Tchernichovsky, Partha P. Mitra",2006-03-01
Imaging phenotypes and genotypes in schizophrenia,/article/10.1385/NI:4:1:21,"Schizophrenia is associated with subtle structural and functional brain abnormalities. Both recent and classical data suggest that it is a heterogeneous disorder that is clearly heritable. The cause and course of schizophrenia are poorly understood, and classical categories of clinical symptoms have not been particularly useful in identifying its pathophysiology or predicting its treatment. The possible genetic risk factors for schizophrenia are numerous; however, the connection between the genotype and the time-course, or the multifaceted symptoms of the disease, has yet to be established. Brain imaging methods that study the structure or function of the cortical and subcortical regions have also identified distinct patterns that distinguish schizophrenics from controls, and that may identify meaningful subtypes of schizophrenia. The predictive relationship between these imaging phenotypes and disease characteristics such as treatment response is only beginning to be revealed. The emergence of the field of imaging genetics, combining genetic, and neuroimaging data, holds much promise for the deeper understanding and improved treatment of diseases such as schizophrenia. In this article we review some of the key findings in imaging phenotyping and genotyping of schizophrenia, and the initial endeavors at their combination into more meaningful and predictive patterns, or endophenotypes identifying the relationships among clinical symptoms, course, genes, and the underlying pathophysiology.","Jessica A.

Mutual information-based feature selection in studying perturbation of dendritic structure caused by TSC2 inactivation,/article/10.1385/NI:4:1:81,"In this study, the effect of protein Tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) on the dendritic spine density and length was demonstrated by using TSC2-RNA inactivation. In addition, the role of rapamycin, an antagonist of the molecular target of rapamycin, in the morphological changes of spine caused by TSC2 silencing was investigated. The features were extracted from high-resolution three-dimensional image stacks collected by two-photon laser scanning microscopy of green fluorescing pyramidal cells expressing TSC2-RNA interference (RNAi), or TSC2-RNAi and rapamycin treatment in rat hippocampal slice cultures. We proposed to apply the lognormal distribution method for feature extraction. The extracted features of three cases under investigation, namely, (1) green-fluorescent protein GFP vs TSC2-RNAi, (2) GFP vs TSC2-RNAi and rapamycin, and (3) TSC2-RNAi vs TSC2-RNAi and rapamycin, were analyzed by mutual information-based feature selection and evaluated by three classifiers, K-nearest neighbor, Perceptron, and two-layer neural networks. The results showed that both the spine density and length have significant morphological changes after TSC2-RNAi treatment. However, rapamycin treatment could reverse the effect of TSC2-RNAi on spine length but not on spine density. These results are consistent with the results reported in the scientific literature. Finally, we explored the application of pattern recognition method in a small sample with richer feature properties, namely bootstrap mutual information estimation and a mutual information-based feature selection method.","Xiaobo Zhou, Jinmin Zhu, ...

"Imaging genomics applied to anxiety, stress response, and resiliency",/article/10.1385/NI:4:1:51,"Anxiety and stress response/resiliency are heritable traits central to the etiology of multiple psychiatric diseases, but efforts to identify genetic variation influencing this broad domain of neurobiological function are hampered by the coarseness of the phenotypic measures and the effects of environmental factors. Neuroimaging offers a powerful approach for assessing functional neuronal activity. Neurophysiological measures can serve as intermediate phenotypes more directly linked to small gene effects, compared with behavioral end points of neural dysfunction. Imaging genomics is a relatively new research area that is concerned with linking functional gene variants and brain information processing. Here, we will focus on processes affected by anxiety and stress. Neuroimaging has been combined with genetic analysis to reveal genetic effects of functional variants of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes on brain response to stressful stimuli. The low-expressing allele of the 5-HTT promoter polymorphism (HTTLPR) is associated with anxiety and with greater amygdala and other regional responses to emotional. The COMT Met158 allele leads to lower COMT activity and has also been associated with anxiety, and the effect of this gene is apparently additive with HTTLPR. Individuals with Met158 genotypes are more sensitive to pain stress and, as shown by C11 Carfentanil imaging, have diminished ability to upregulate opioid release after pain/stress. These results suggest that functional variants of 5-HTT and COMT impact brain functions involved in stress and anxiety.","Ke Xu, Monique Ernst, David Goldman",2006-03-01
Bayesian variable selection for gene expression modeling with regulatory motif binding sites in neuroinflammatory events,/article/10.1385/NI:4:1:95,"Multiple transcription factors (TFs) coordinately control transcriptional regulation of genes in eukaryotes. Although numerous computational methods focus on the identification of individual TF-binding sites (TFBSs), very few consider the interdependence among these sites. In this article, we studied the relationship between TFBSs and microarray gene expression levels using both family-wise and member-specific motifs, under various combination of regression models with Bayesian variable selection, as well as motif scoring and sharing conditions, in order to account for the coordination complexity of transcription regulation. We proposed a three-step approach to model the relationship. In the first step, we preprocessed microarray data and usedp-values and expression ratios to preselect upregulated and down-regulated genes. The second step aimed to identify and score individual TFBSs within DNA sequence of each gene. A method based on the degree of similarity and the number of TFBSs was employed to calculate the score of each TFBS in each gene sequence. In the last step, linear regression and probit regression were used to build a predictive model of gene expression outcomes using these TFBSs as predictors. Given a certain number of predictors to be used, a full search of all possible predictor sets is usually combinatorially prohibitive. Therefore, this article considered the Bayesian variable selection for prediction using either of the regression models. The Bayesian variable selection applied in the context of gene selection, missing value estimation, and regulatory motif identification. In our modeling, the regressor was approximated as a linear combination of the TFBSs and a Gibbs sampler was employed to find the strongest TFBSs. We applied these regression models with the Bayesian variable selection on spinal cord injury gene expression data set. These TFs demonstrated intricate regulatory roles either as a family or as individual members in neuroinflammatory events. Our an alysis can be applied to create plausible hypotheses for combinatorial regulation by TFBSs and avoiding false-positive candidates in the modeling process at the same time. Such a systematic approach provides the possibility to dissect transcription regulation, from a more comprehensive perspective, through which phenotypical events at cellular and tissue levels are moved forward by molecular events at gene transcription and translation levels.","Kuang-Yu Liu, Xiaobo Zhou, ...

A comparative analysis of multi-conductance neuronal models in silico,/article/10.1007/s00422-006-0111-7,"We demonstrate that a previously presented flexible silicon–neuron architecture can implement three disparate conductance-based neuron models with both fast and slow dynamics. By exploiting the real-time nature of this physical implementation, we mapped the model dynamics across a large region of parameter space. We also found that two of these dynamically different models represent points in a contiguous bursting space that spans between the two models. By systematically varying the model parameters, we also found that multiple, diverse trajectories in parameter space connected the two canonical bursting points. In addition, we found that the combination of parameter values keeps the neuron in the bursting region. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of the silicon–neuron architecture as a neural-modeling tool and illustrate its versatility as a platform for a multi-behavioral neuron that resembles its living analog.","Stephen P.

Engineering entrainment and adaptation in limit cycle systems,/article/10.1007/s00422-006-0128-y,"Periodic behavior is key to life and is observed in multiple instances and at multiple time scales in our metabolism, our natural environment, and our engineered environment. A natural way of modeling or generating periodic behavior is done by using oscillators, i.e., dynamical systems that exhibit limit cycle behavior. While there is extensive literature on methods to analyze such dynamical systems, much less work has been done on methods to synthesize an oscillator to exhibit some specific desired characteristics. The goal of this article is twofold: (1) to provide a framework for characterizing and designing oscillators and (2) to review how classes of well-known oscillators can be understood and related to this framework. The basis of the framework is to characterize oscillators in terms of their fundamental temporal and spatial behavior and in terms of properties that these two behaviors can be designed to exhibit. This focus on fundamental properties is important because it allows us to systematically compare a large variety of oscillators that might at first sight appear very different from each other. We identify several specifications that are useful for design, such as frequency-locking behavior, phase-locking behavior, and specific output signal shape. We also identify two classes of design methods by which these specifications can be met, namely offline methods and online methods. By relating these specifications to our framework and by presenting several examples of how oscillators have been designed in the literature, this article provides a useful methodology and toolbox for designing oscillators for a wide range of purposes. In particular, the focus on synthesis of limit cycle dynamical systems should be useful both for engineering and for computational modeling of physical or biological phenomena.","Jonas Buchli, Ludovic Righetti, Auke Jan Ijspeert",2006-12-05
Implications for Cognitive Quantum Computation and Decoherence Limits in the Presence of Large Extra Dimensions,/article/10.1007/s10773-006-9221-1,"An interdisciplinary physical theory of emergent consciousness has previously been proposed, stemming from quantum computation-like behavior between 109 or more entangled molecular qubit states (microtubulin). This model relies on the Penrose-Diósi gravity-driven wavefunction collapse framework, and thus is subject to any secondary classical and quantum gravity effects. Specifically, if large extra spatial dimensions exist in the Universe, then the resulting corrections to Newtonian gravity cause this model to suffer serious difficulties. It is shown that if the extra dimensions are larger than 100 fm in size, then this model of consciousness is unphysical. If the dimensions are on the order of 10 fm in size, then a significantly smaller number of microtubulin than originally predicted are required to satisfy experimental constraints. Some speculation on evolution of consciousness is also offered, based on the possibility that the size of these extra dimensions may have been changing over the history of the Universe.",J. R.

We propose a new approach to their detection, using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a data-driven approach removing the need for arbitrary bandpass filter cut-offs. Phase locking is sought between modes. We explore the features of EMD, including making a quantitative assessment of its ability to preserve phase content of signals, and proceed to develop a statistical framework with which to assess synchrony episodes. Furthermore, we propose a new approach to ensure signal decomposition using EMD. We adapt the Hilbert spectrum to a time-frequency representation of phase locking and are able to locate synchrony successfully in time and frequency between synthetic signals reminiscent of EEG. We compare our approach, which we call EMD phase locking analysis (EMDPL) with existing methods and show it to offer improved time-frequency localisation of synchrony.","C. M. Sweeney-Reed, S. J.

A wavelet-based statistical analysis of fMRI data,/article/10.1385/NI:3:4:319,"We propose a new method for statistical analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The discrete wavelet transformation is employed as a tool for efficient and robust signal representation. We use structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fMRI to empirically estimate the distribution of the wavelet coefficients of the data both across individuals and spatial locations. An anatomical subvolume probabilistic atlas is used to tessellate the structural and functional signals into smaller regions each of which is processed separately. A frequency-adaptive wavelet shrinkage scheme is employed to obtain essentially optimal estimations of the signals in the wavelet space. The empirical distributions of the signals on all the regions are computed in a compressed wavelet space. These are modeled by heavy-tail distributions because their histograms exhibit slower tail decay than the Gaussian.

Finally, we propose a new model for statistical analysis of functional MRI data using this atlas-based wavelet space representation.

Phase synchronization measurements using electroencephalographic recordings,/article/10.1385/NI:3:4:301,"Phase synchrony analysis is a relatively new concept that is being increasingly used on neurophysiological data obtained through different methodologies. It is currently believed that phase synchrony is an important signature of information binding between distant sites of the brain, especially during cognitive tasks. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are the most widely used recording technique for recording brain signals and assessing phase synchrony patterns. In this study, we address the suitability of phase synchrony analysis in EEG recordings. Using geometrical arguments and numerical examples, employing EEG and magnetoencephalographic data, we show that the presence of a common reference signal in the case of EEG recordings results in a distortion of the synchrony values observed, in that the amplitudes of the signals influence the synchrony measured, and in general destroys the intended physical interpretation of phase synchrony.","Ramón Guevara, José Luis Pérez Velazquez, ...

Experiments and models of sensorimotor interactions during locomotion,/article/10.1007/s00422-006-0129-x,"During locomotion sensory information from cutaneous and muscle receptors is continuously integrated with the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) to generate an appropriate motor output to meet the demands of the environment. Sensory signals from peripheral receptors can strongly impact the timing and amplitude of locomotor activity. This sensory information is gated centrally depending on the state of the system (i.e., rest vs. locomotion) but is also modulated according to the phase of a given task. Consequently, if one is to devise biologically relevant walking models it is imperative that these sensorimotor interactions at the spinal level be incorporated into the control system.","Alain Frigon, Serge Rossignol",2006-11-18
A cross-platform freeware tool for digital reconstruction of neuronal arborizations from image stacks,/article/10.1385/NI:3:4:343,"Digital reconstruction of neuronal arborizations is an important step in the quantitative investigation of cellular neuroanatomy. In this process, neurites imaged by microscopy are semi-manually traced through the use of specialized computer software and represented as binary trees of branching cylinders (or truncated cones). Such form of the reconstruction files is efficient and parsimonious, and allows extensive morphometric analysis as well as the implementation of biophysical models of electrophysiology. Here, we describe Neuron_Morpho, a plugin for the popular Java application ImageJ that mediates the digital reconstruction of neurons from image stacks. Both the executable and code of Neuron_Morpho are freely distributed (www.maths.soton.ac.uk/staff/D’Alessandro/morpho or www.krasnow.gmu.edu/L-Neuron), and are compatible with all major computer platforms (including Windows, Mac, and Linux). We tested Neuron_Morpho by reconstructing two neurons from each of the two preparations representing different brain areas (hippocampus and cerebellum), neuritic type (pyramidal cell dendrites and olivar axonal projection terminals), and labeling method (rapid Golgi impregnation and anterograde dextran amine), and quantitatively comparing the resulting morphologies to those of the same cells reconstructed with the standard commercial system, Neurolucida. None of the numerous morphometric measures that were analyzed displayed any significant or systematic difference between the two reconstructing systems.","Kerry M. Brown, Duncan E. Donohue, ...

The recent TT-2004 version is substantially improved over the digitized print original with a higher structure parcellation, better quality and resolution of individual structures, and improved three-dimensional (3D) spatial consistency. It is also much more suitable for developing atlas-based applications owing to pure color-coding (for automatic structure labeling), contour representation (to avoid scan blocking by the overlaid atlas), and color cross-atlas consistency (for the simultaneous use of multiple atlases). We also provide a procedure for 3D spatial consistency improvement and illustrate its use. Finally, we present some of our latest atlas-assisted applications for fast and automatic interpretation of morphological, stroke, and molecular images, and discuss the future steps in TT atlas enhancement.",Wieslaw L.

Robustness of the significance of spike synchrony with respect to sorting errors,/article/10.1007/s10827-006-8899-7,"The aim of spike sorting is to reconstruct single unit spike times from extracellular multi-unit recordings. Failure in the identification of a spike (false negative) or assignment of a spike to a wrong unit (false positive) are typical examples of sorting errors. Their influence on cross-correlation measures has been addressed and it has been shown that correlation analysis of multi-unit signals may lead to incorrect interpretations. We formulate a model to study the influence of sorting errors on the significance of synchronized spikes, and thus are able to study if and how the significance changes in case of imperfect sorting. Here we explore the case of pairwise analysis of simultaneously recorded neurons. Interestingly, a decrease in the significance is observed in the presence of false positives, as well as for false negatives. Furthermore, false negative errors reduce the significance of synchronized spikes more strongly than false positives. Thus, conservative sorting strategies have a stronger tendency to lead to a loss of the significance of synchronization. We demonstrate that a detailed understanding of sorting techniques and their possible effects on subsequent data analyses is important in order to rule out inconsistencies in the interpretation of results.","Antonio Pazienti, Sonja Grün",2006-08-14
Computational simulation of the input-output relationship in hippocampal pyramidal cells,/article/10.1007/s10827-006-8797-z,"The precise mapping of how complex patterns of synaptic inputs are integrated into specific patterns of spiking output is an essential step in the characterization of the cellular basis of network dynamics and function. Relative to other principal neurons of the hippocampus, the electrophysiology of CA1 pyramidal cells has been extensively investigated. Yet, the precise input-output relationship is to date unknown even for this neuronal class. CA1 pyramidal neurons receive laminated excitatory inputs from three distinct pathways: recurrent CA1 collaterals on basal dendrites, CA3 Schaffer collaterals, mostly on oblique and proximal apical dendrites, and entorhinal perforant pathway on distal apical dendrites. We implemented detailed computer simulations of pyramidal cell electrophysiology based on three-dimensional anatomical reconstructions and compartmental models of available biophysical properties from the experimental literature. To investigate the effect of synaptic input on axosomatic firing, we stochastically distributed a realistic number of excitatory synapses in each of the three dendritic layers. We then recorded the spiking response to different stimulation patterns. For all dendritic layers, synchronous stimuli resulted in trains of spiking output and a linear relationship between input and output firing frequencies. In contrast, asynchronous stimuli evoked non-bursting spike patterns and the corresponding firing frequency input-output function was logarithmic. The regular/irregular nature of the input synaptic intervals was only reflected in the regularity of output inter-burst intervals in response to synchronous stimulation, and never affected firing frequency. Synaptic stimulations in the basal and proximal apical trees across individual neuronal morphologies yielded remarkably similar input-output relationships. Results were also robust with respect to the detailed distributions of dendritic and synaptic conductances within a plausible range constrained by experimental evidence. In contrast, the input-output relationship in response to distal apical stimuli showed dramatic differences from the other dendritic locations as well as among neurons, and was more sensible to the exact channel densities.","Xiaoshen Li, Giorgio A.

Dynamical neural networks: Modeling low-level vision at short latencies,/article/10.1140/epjst/e2007-00061-7,"Our goal is to understand the dynamics of neural
computations in low-level vision. We study how the substrate
of this system, that is local biochemical neural processes,
could combine to give rise to an efficient and global perception. We
will study these neural computations at different scales from the
single-cell to the whole visual system to infer generic aspects of
the under-  lying neural code which may help to understand this
cognitive ability. In fact, the architecture of cortical
areas, such as the Primary Visual Cortex (V1), is massively parallel
and we will focus on cortical columns as generic adaptive
micro-circuits. To stress on the dynamical aspect of the processing,
we will also focus on the transient response, that is during the
first milliseconds after the presentation  of a stimulus.  In
a generic model of a visual area, we propose to study the neural
code as implementing visual pattern matching, that is as
efficiently inverting a known model of image synthesis. A possible
solution offered by the architecture of the visual pathways
could be to represent at first on the surface of the cortical area
how well the prototypical visual features are matched by a
combination of inferential mechanisms as ideal observers. We
studied the efficiency of this representation by rating the
statistics of the output using natural scenes, that is scenes
occurring frequently. We show that this may be finally used to
provide a behavioral output such as an eye movement. 
However, constraints specific to the visual system imply that the
set of prototypical features is not independent and that the
cortical columns should communicate to produce an efficient, sparse
solution. We will present efficient algorithms and representations
based on the event-based nature of neural computations. By
explicitely defining this efficiency, we propose then a simple
implementation of Sparse Spike Coding using greedy
inference mechanisms but also how the system may adapt in a
unsupervised fashion. These computations may be implemented in
simple models of neural networks by explicitly setting the lateral
connectivity between populations of columns. Using natural scenes,
this algorithm provides a model of V1 which exhibit prototypical
properties of neural activities in that area. We show simple
applications in the field of image processing as a quantitative
method to evaluate these different cortical models.",L. Perrinet,2007-03-01

This also presents new opportunities for understanding the role of informatics in scientific work practices, and for designing new kinds tools and resources needed to support them. These issues of data management, scientific communication and collective activity are brought together at once in scientific data collections (SDCs). What can the development and use of shared SDCs tell us about collective activity, dynamic infrastructures, and distributed scientific work? Using examples drawn from a nascent neuroscience data collection, we examine some unique features of SDCs to illustrate that they do more than act as infrastructures for scientific research. Instead, we argue that they are themselves instantiations of Distributed Collective Practice (DCP), and as such illustrate concepts of transition, emergence, and interdependency that may not be so apparent in other kinds of DCPs. We propose that research into SDCs can yield new insights into institutional arrangements, policymaking, and authority structures in other very large-scale socio-technical networks.","Melissa H.

Methods for quantifying the informational structure of sensory and motor data,/article/10.1385/NI:3:3:243,"Embodied agents (organisms and robots) are situated in specific environments sampled by their sensors and within which they carry out motor activity. Their control architectures or nervous systems attend to and process streams of sensory stimulation, and ultimately generate sequences of motor actions, which in turn affect the selection of information. Thus, sensory input and motor activity are continuously and dynamically coupled with the surrounding environment. In this article, we propose that the ability of embodied agents to actively structure their sensory input and to generate statistical regularities represents a major functional rationale for the dynamic coupling between sensory and motor systems. Statistical regularities in the multimodal sensory data relayed to the brain are critical for enabling appropriate developmental processes, perceptual categorization, adaptation, and learning. To characterize the informational structure of sensory and motor data, we introduce and illustrate a set of univariate and multivariate statistical measures (available in an accompanying Matlab toolbox). We show how such measures can be used to quantify the information structure in sensory and motor channels of a robot capable of saliency-based attentional behavior, and discuss their potential importance for understanding sensorimotor coordination in organisms and for robot design.","Max Lungarella, Teresa Pegors, ...

Effects of random external background stimulation on network synaptic stability after tetanization,/article/10.1385/NI:3:3:263,"We constructed a simulated spiking neural network model to investigate the effects of random background stimulation on the dynamics of network activity patterns and tetanus induced network plasticity. The simulated model was a “leaky integrate-and-fire” (LIF) neural model with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and frequency-dependent synaptic depression. Spontaneous and evoked activity patterns were compared with those of living neuronal networks cultured on multielectrode arrays. To help visualize activity patterns and plasticity in our simulated model, we introduced new population measures called Center of Activity (CA) and Center of Weights (CW) to describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of network-wide firing activity and network-wide synaptic strength, respectively. Without random background stimulation, the network synaptic weights were unstable and often drifted after tetanization. In contrast, with random background stimulation, the network synaptic weights remained close to their values immediately after tetanization. The simulation suggests that the effects of tetanization on network synaptic weights were difficult to control because of ongoing synchronized spontaneous bursts of action potentials, or “barrages.” Random background stimulation helped maintain network synaptic stability after tetanization by reducing the number and thus the influence of spontaneous barrages. We used our simulated network to model the interaction between ongoing neural activity, external stimulation and plasticity, and to guide our choice of sensory-motor mappings for adaptive behavior in hybrid neural-robotic systems or “hybrots.”","Zenas C.

Clustering of Dependent Components: A New Paradigm for fMRI Signal Detection,/article/10.1155/ASP.2005.3089,"Exploratory data-driven methods such as unsupervised clustering and independent component analysis (ICA) are considered to be hypothesis-generating procedures and are complementary to the hypothesis-led statistical inferential methods in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recently, a new paradigm in ICA emerged, that of finding ""clusters"" of dependent components. This intriguing idea found its implementation into two new ICA algorithms: tree-dependent and topographic ICA. For fMRI, this represents the unifying paradigm of combining two powerful exploratory data analysis methods, ICA and unsupervised clustering techniques. For the fMRI data, a comparative quantitative evaluation between the two methods, tree-dependent and topographic ICA, was performed. The comparative results were evaluated by (1) task-related activation maps, (2) associated time courses, and (3) ROC study. The most important findings in this paper are that (1) both tree-dependent and topographic ICA are able to identify signal components with high correlation to the fMRI stimulus, and that (2) topographic ICA outperforms all other ICA methods including tree-dependent ICA for 8 and 9 ICs. However for 16 ICs, topographic ICA is outperformed by tree-dependent ICA (KGV) using as an approximation of the mutual information the kernel generalized variance.

Analog Integrated 2-D Optical Flow Sensor,/article/10.1007/s10470-005-0439-2,"I present a new focal-plane analog very-large-scale-integrated (aVLSI) sensor that estimates optical flow in two visual dimensions. Its computational architecture consists of a two-layer network of locally connected motion units that collectively estimate the optimal optical flow field. The applied gradient-based optical flow model assumes visual motion to be translational and smooth, and is formulated as a convex optimization problem. The model also guarantees that the estimation problem is well-posed regardless of the visual input by imposing a bias towards a preferred motion under ambiguous or noisy visual conditions. Model parameters can be globally adjusted, leading to a rich output behavior. Varying the smoothness strength, for example, can provide a continuous spectrum of motion estimates, ranging from normal to global optical flow. The non-linear network conductances improve the resulting optical flow estimate because they reduce spatial smoothing across large velocity differences and minimize the bias for reliable stimuli. Extended characterization and recorded optical flow fields from a 30 × 30 array prototype sensor demonstrate the validity of the optical flow model and the robustness and functionality of the computational architecture and its implementation.",Alan A.

Learning to Attend: Modeling the Shaping of Selectivity in Infero-temporal Cortex in a Categorization Task,/article/10.1007/s00422-006-0054-z,"Recent experiments on behaving monkeys have shown that learning a visual categorization task makes the neurons in infero-temporal cortex (ITC) more selective to the task-relevant features of the stimuli (Sigala and Logothetis in Nature 415 318–320, 2002). We hypothesize that such a selectivity modulation emerges from the interaction between ITC and other cortical area, presumably the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where the previously learned stimulus categories are encoded. We propose a biologically inspired model of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons with plastic synapses, modified according to a reward based Hebbian learning rule, to explain the experimental results and test the validity of our hypothesis. We assume that the ITC neurons, receiving feature selective inputs, form stronger connections with the category specific neurons to which they are consistently associated in rewarded trials. After learning, the top-down influence of PFC neurons enhances the selectivity of the ITC neurons encoding the behaviorally relevant features of the stimuli, as observed in the experiments. We conclude that the perceptual representation in visual areas like ITC can be strongly affected by the interaction with other areas which are devoted to higher cognitive functions.","Miruna Szabo, Martin Stetter, ...

Statistical criteria in fMRI studies of multisensory integration,/article/10.1385/NI:3:2:093,"Inferences drawn from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are dependent on the statistical criteria used to define different brain regions as “active” or “inactive” under the experimental manipulation. In fMRI studies of multisensory integration, additional criteria are used to classify a subset of the active brain regions as “multisensory.” Because there is no general agreement in the literature on the optimal criteria for performing this classification, we investigated the effects of seven different multisensory stat-istical criteria on a single test dataset collected as human subjects performed auditory, visual, and auditory-visual object recognition. Activation maps created using the different criteria differed dramatically. The classification of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) was used as a performance measure, because a large body of converging evidence demonstrates that the STS is important for auditory-visual integration. A commonly proposed criterion, “supra-additivity” or “super-additivity”, which requires the multisensory response to be larger than the summed unisensory responses, did not classify STS as multisensory. Alternative criteria, such as requiring the multisensory response to be larger than the maximum or the mean of the unisensory responses, successfully classified STS as multisensory. This practical demonstration strengthens theoretical arguments that the super-additivity is not an appropriate criterion for all studies of multisensory integration. Moreover, the importance of examining evoked fMRI responses, whole brain activation maps, maps from multiple individual subjects, and mixed-effect group maps are discussed in the context of selecting statistical criteria.",Michael S.

Comparison of vector space model methodologies to reconcile cross-species neuroanatomical concepts,/article/10.1385/NI:3:2:115,"Generating informational thesauri that classify, cross-reference, and retrieve diverse and highly detailed neuroscientific information requires identifying related neuroanatomical terms and acronyms within and between species (Gorin et al., 2001) Manual construction of such informational thesauri is laborious, and we describe implementing and evaluating a neuroanatomical term and acronym reconciliation (NTAR) system to assist domain experts with this task. NTAR is composed of two modules. The neuroanatomical term extraction (NTE) module employs a hidden Markov model (HMM) in conjunction with lexical rules to extract neuroanatomical terms (NT) and acronyms (NA) from textual material. The output of the NTE is formatted into collections of term- or acronym-indexed documents composed of sentences and word phrases extracted from textual material. The second information retrieval (IR) module utilizes a vector space model (VSM) and includes a novel, automated relevance feedback algorithm. The IR module retrieves statistically related neuroanatomical terms and acronyms in response to queried neuroanatomical terms and acronyms. Neuroanatomical terms and acronyms retrieval obtained from term-based inquiries were compared with (1) term retrieval obtained by including automated relevance feedback and with (2) term retrieval using “document-to-document” comparisons (context-based VSM). The retrieval of synonymous and similar primate and macaque thalamic terms and acronyms in response to a query list of human thalamic terminology by these three IR approaches was compared against a previously published, manually constructed concordance table of homologous cross-species terms and acronyms. Term-based VSM with automated relevance feedback retrieved 70% and 80% of these primate and macaque terms and acronyms, respectively, listed in the concordance table. Automated feedback algorithm correctly identified 87% of the macaque terms and acronyms that were independently selected by a domain expert as being appropriate for manual relevance feedback. Context-based VSM correctly retrieved 97% and 98% of the primate and macaque terms and acronyms listed in the term homology table.

Specific membrane, cytoskeletal, junctional, extracellular matrix proteins and organelles interact to maintain and regulate associated ion movements between spaces in the nodal complex, potentially influencing response variation during repetitive activations or metabolic stress. Understanding and building high resolution three dimensional (3D) structures of the node of Ranvier, including localization of specific macromolecules, is crucial to a better understanding of the relationship between its structure and function and the macromolecular basis for impaired conduction in disease. Using serial section electron tomographic methods, we have constructed accurate 3D models of the nodal complex from mouse spinal roots with resolution better than 7.5nm. These reconstructed volumes contain 75–80% of the thickness of the nodal region. We also directly imaged the glial axonal junctions that serve to anchor the terminal loops of the myelin lamellae to the axolemma. We created a model of an intact node of Ranvier by truncating the volume at its mid-point in Z, duplicating the remaining volume and then merging the new half volume with mirror symmetry about the Z-axis. We added to this model the distribution and number of Na+ channels on this reconstruction using tools associated with the MCell simulation program environment. The model created provides accurate structural descriptions of the membrane compartments, external spaces, and formed structures enabling more realistic simulations of the role of the node in modulation of impulse propagation than have been conducted on myelinated nerve previously.","Gina E.

Metastasis Predictive Signature Profiles Pre-exist in Normal Tissues,/article/10.1007/s10585-005-6244-6,"Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that metastatic propensity is significantly influenced by the genetic background upon which tumors arise. We have also established that human gene expression profiles predictive of metastasis are not only present in mouse tumors with both high and low metastatic capacity, but also correlate with genetic background. These results suggest that human metastasis-predictive gene expression signatures may be significantly driven by genetic background, rather than acquired somatic mutations. To test this hypothesis, gene expression profiling was performed on inbred mouse strains with significantly different metastatic efficiencies. Analysis of previously described human metastasis signature gene expression patterns in normal tissues permitted accurate categorization of high or low metastatic mouse genotypes. Furthermore, prospective identification of animals at high risk of metastasis was achieved by using mass spectrometry to characterize salivary peptide polymorphisms in a genetically heterogeneous population. These results strongly support the role of constitutional genetic variation in modulation of metastatic efficiency and suggest that predictive signature profiles could be developed from normal tissues in humans. The ability to identify those individuals at high risk of disseminated disease at the time of clinical manifestation of a primary cancer could have a significant impact on cancer management.","Haiyan Yang, Nigel Crawford, ...

"Growth-driven percolations: the dynamics of connectivity 
in neuronal systems",/article/10.1140/epjb/e2005-00354-5,"The quintessential property of neuronal systems is their
 intensive patterns of selective synaptic connections. The current
 work describes a physics-based approach to neuronal shape modeling and
 synthesis and its consideration for the simulation of neuronal
 development and the formation of neuronal communities. Starting from
 images of real neurons, geometrical measurements are obtained and used
 to construct probabilistic models which can be subsequently sampled in
 order to produce morphologically realistic neuronal cells. Such cells
 are progressively grown while monitoring their connections along time,
 which are analysed in terms of percolation concepts. However, unlike
 traditional percolation, the critical point is verified along the
 growth stages, not the density of cells, which remains constant
 throughout the neuronal growth dynamics. It is shown, through
 simulations, that growing beta cells tend to reach percolation sooner
 than the alpha counterparts with the same diameter. Also, the
 percolation becomes more abrupt for higher densities of cells, being
 markedly sharper for the beta cells. In the addition to the
 importance of the reported concepts and methods to computational
 neuroscience, the possibility of reaching percolation through
 morphological growth of a fixed number of objects represents in itself
 a novel paradigm of great theoretical and practical interest for the
 areas of statistical physics and critical phenomena.","L. da Fontoura Costa, R. C. Coelho",2005-10-01

Local Diameter Fully Constrains Dendritic Size in Basal but not Apical Trees of CA1 Pyramidal Neurons,/article/10.1007/s10827-005-1850-5,"Computational modeling of dendritic morphology is a powerful tool for quantitatively describing complex geometrical relationships, uncovering principles of dendritic development, and synthesizing virtual neurons to systematically investigate cellular biophysics and network dynamics. A feature common to many morphological models is a dependence of the branching probability on local diameter. Previous models of this type have been able to recreate a wide variety of dendritic morphologies. However, these diameter-dependent models have so far failed to properly constrain branching when applied to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, leading to explosive growth. Here we present a simple modification of this basic approach, in which all parameter sampling, not just bifurcation probability, depends on branch diameter. This added constraint prevents explosive growth in both apical and basal trees of simulated CA1 neurons, yielding arborizations with average numbers and patterns of bifurcations extremely close to those observed in real cells. However, simulated apical trees are much more varied in size than the corresponding real dendrites. We show that, in this model, the excessive variability of simulated trees is a direct consequence of the natural variability of diameter changes at and between bifurcations observed in apical, but not basal, dendrites. Conversely, some aspects of branch distribution were better matched by virtual apical trees than by virtual basal trees. Dendritic morphometrics related to spatial position, such as path distance from the soma or branch order, may be necessary to fully constrain CA1 apical tree size and basal branching pattern.","Duncan E.

Stimulus-invariant processing and spectrotemporal reverse correlation in primary auditory cortex,/article/10.1007/s10827-005-3589-4,"The spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) provides a versatile and integrated, spectral and temporal, functional characterization of single cells in primary auditory cortex (AI). In this paper, we explore the origin of, and relationship between, different ways of measuring and analyzing an STRF. We demonstrate that STRFs measured using a spectrotemporally diverse array of broadband stimuli—such as dynamic ripples, spectrotemporally white noise, and temporally orthogonal ripple combinations (TORCs)—are very similar, confirming earlier findings that the STRF is a robust linear descriptor of the cell. We also present a new deterministic analysis framework that employs the Fourier series to describe the spectrotemporal modulations contained in the stimuli and responses. Additional insights into the STRF measurements, including the nature and interpretation of measurement errors, is presented using the Fourier transform, coupled to singular-value decomposition (SVD), and variability analyses including bootstrap. The results promote the utility of the STRF as a core functional descriptor of neurons in AI.","David J. Klein, Jonathan Z. Simon, ... Shihab A. Shamma",2006-02-20

Functional Topology Classification of Biological Computing Networks,/article/10.1007/s11047-005-3667-6,"Current analyses of complex biological networks focus either on their global statistical connectivity properties (e.g. topological path lengths and nodes connectivity ranks) or the statistics of specific local connectivity circuits (motifs). Here we present a different approach – Functional Topology, to enable identification of hidden topological and geometrical fingerprints of biological computing networks that afford their functioning – the form-function fingerprints. To do so we represent the network structure in terms of three matrices: 1. Topological connectivity matrix – each row (i) is the shortest topological path lengths of node i with all other nodes; 2. Topological correlation matrix – the element (i,j) is the correlation between the topological connectivity of nodes (i) and (j); and 3. Weighted graph matrix – in this case the links represent the conductance between nodes that can be simply one over the geometrical length, the synaptic strengths in case of neural networks or other quantity that represents the strengths of the connections. Various methods (e.g. clustering algorithms, random matrix theory, eigenvalues spectrum etc.), can be used to analyze these matrices, here we use the newly developed functional holography approach which is based on clustering of the matrices following their collective normalization. We illustrate the approach by analyzing networks of different topological and geometrical properties: 1. Artificial networks, including – random, regular 4-fold and 5-fold lattice and a tree-like structure; 2. Cultured neural networks: A single network and a network composed of three linked sub-networks; and 3. Model neural network composed of two overlapping sub-networks. Using these special networks, we demonstrate the method’s ability to reveal functional topology features of the networks.","Pablo Blinder, Itay Baruchi, ... Eshel Ben Jacob",2005-09-01

A probabilistic functional atlas of the human subthalamic nucleus,/article/10.1385/NI:2:4:381,"This paper introduces a method for generation and validation of a probabilistic functional brain atlas of subcortical structures from electrophysiological and neuroimaging data. The method contains three major steps: (1) acquisition of pre, intra, and postoperative multimodal data; (2) selection of an accurate data set for atlas generation; and (3) generation of the atlas from the selected data set. The method is applied to construct the probabilistic functional atlas of the human subthalamic nucleus (STN). The STN atlas has been built from data collected during surgical treatment of 184 patients with Parkinson’s disease. It is based on preoperative X-ray ventriculography imaging, intraoperative electrophysiological measurements and X-ray imaging, and postoperative neurological assessment. The atlas features a high resolution of 0.25 mm3 and a high accuracy of 0.25 mm. It is dynamic and can be rapidly recalculated for arbitrary resolution and extended by adding new patient data. The atlas can easily be reformatted and warped to match patient-specific data. Its applications include planning of subthalamic stimulations and neuroscience research to study functional properties of the STN. The presented method is general and can be applied for constructing human and animal probabilistic brain atlases.","Wieslaw L. Nowinski, Dmitry Belov, ... Alim Louis Benabid",2004-12-01

Based on timing tests, it is shown that FPGAs can outperform traditional desktop computers in simulating these fairly simple models and would most likely provide even larger performance gains over computers in simulating more complex models. The potential of this method for improving neural modeling and dynamic clamping is discussed. In particular, it is believed that this approach could greatly speed up simulations of both highly complex single neuron models and networks of neurons. Additionally, our design is particularly well suited to automated parameter searches for tuning model behavior and to real-time simulation.","E. L. Graas, E. A. Brown, Robert H. Lee",2004-12-01
Artificial neural networks and artificial organisms can predict alzheimer pathology in individual patients only on the basis of cognitive and functional status,/article/10.1385/NI:2:4:399,"Data from several studies have pointed out the existence of a strong correlation between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology and cognitive state. However, because of their highly complex and nonlinear relationship, it has been difficult to develop a predictive model for individual patient classification through traditional statistical approaches. When exposed to complex data sets, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can recognize patterns, learn the relationship of different variables, and address classification tasks. To predict the results of postmortem brain examinations, we applied ANNs to the Nun Study data set, a longitudinal epidemiological study, which includes annual cognitive and functional evaluation. One hundred seventeen subjects from the study participated in this analysis. We determined how demographic data and the cognitive and functional variables of each subject during the last year of her life could predict the presence of brain pathology expressed as Braak stages, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs) count in the neocortex and hippocampus, and brain atrophy. The result of this analysis was then compared with traditional statistical models. ANNs proved to be better predictors than Linear Discriminant Analysis in all experimentations (+ ∼10% in overall accuracy), especially when assembled in Artificial Organisms (+ ∼20% in overall accuracy). Demographic, cognitive, and clinical variables were better predictors of tangles count in the neocortex and in the hippocampus when compared to NPs count. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that neurofibrillary pathology may represent the major anatomic substrate of the cognitive impairment found in AD.","Massimo Buscema, Enzo Grossi, ...

We invoke a simple probabilistic framework in which kernel density estimates are used to model distributions of brain activation foci conditioned on words in a given abstract.

Learning viewpoint invariant object representations using a temporal coherence principle,/article/10.1007/s00422-005-0585-8,"Invariant object recognition is arguably one of the major challenges for contemporary machine vision systems. In contrast, the mammalian visual system performs this task virtually effortlessly. How can we exploit our knowledge on the biological system to improve artificial systems? Our understanding of the mammalian early visual system has been augmented by the discovery that general coding principles could explain many aspects of neuronal response properties. How can such schemes be transferred to system level performance? In the present study we train cells on a particular variant of the general principle of temporal coherence, the “stability” objective. These cells are trained on unlabeled real-world images without a teaching signal. We show that after training, the cells form a representation that is largely independent of the viewpoint from which the stimulus is looked at. This finding includes generalization to previously unseen viewpoints. The achieved representation is better suited for view-point invariant object classification than the cells’ input patterns. This property to facilitate view-point invariant classification is maintained even if training and classification take place in the presence of an – also unlabeled – distractor object. In summary, here we show that unsupervised learning using a general coding principle facilitates the classification of real-world objects, that are not segmented from the background and undergo complex, non-isomorphic, transformations.","Wolfgang Einhäuser, Jörg Hipp, ...

Bias Current Generators with Wide Dynamic Range,/article/10.1007/s10470-005-1606-1,"Mixed-signal or analog chips often require a wide range of biasing currents that are independent of process and supply voltage and that are proportional to absolute temperature. This paper describes CMOS circuits that we use to generate a set of fixed bias currents typically spanning six decades at room temperature down to a few times the transistor off-current. A bootstrapped current reference with a new startup and power-control mechanism generates a master current, which is successively divided by a current splitter to generate the desired reference currents. These references are nondestructively copied to form the chip’s biases. Measurements of behavior, including temperature effects from 1.6 and 0.35 μ implementations, are presented and nonidealities are investigated. Temperature dependence of the transistor off-current is investigated because it determines the lower limit for generated currents. Readers are directed to a design kit that allows easy generation of the complete layout for a bias generator with a set of desired currents for scalable MOSIS CMOS processes.","Tobi Delbrück, André Van Schaik",2005-06-01
The use of a self-organizing feature map for the treatment of the results of RAPD and ISSR analyses in studies on the genomic polymorphism in the genus Capsicum L.,/article/10.1007/s11177-005-0045-5,"The results of studies based on multilocus molecular analyses, including random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses, are usually presented in the form of images (electrophoregrams, photographs, etc.). The interpretation of this information is complicated, labor-consuming, and subjective. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are ideal “image processors,” may be useful when solving such tasks. The possibility of using ANNs for the treatment of the results of RAPD and ISSR analyses has been studied. The RAPD and ISSR fragment spectra of the genus Capsicum L.

The results of clustering the accessions studied by means of the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA), which is often used for phylogenetic constructions based on RAPD and ISSR data, serve as expert estimates. Fundamentally new methods of genetic polymorphism estimation using ANN technologies, namely, self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs) have been developed. The results show that the clusters obtained with the use of UPGMA and SOFM coincide by more than 90%; taking into account that ANNs can deal with high noise levels and incomplete or contradictory data, the approach proposed may prove to be efficient.","V.

First advantage of this method is a form of the functional to be minimized which becomes quadratic at the step of the vertices position refinement. This makes the algorithm very effective, especially for parallel implementations. Another advantage is that the same algorithmic kernel is applied to construct principal manifolds of different dimensions and topologies. We demonstrate how flexibility of the approach allows numerous adaptive strategies like principal graph constructing, etc. The algorithm is implemented as a C++ package elmap and as a part of stand-alone data visualization tool VidaExpert, available on the web.

Scaling self-organizing maps to model large cortical networks,/article/10.1385/NI:2:3:275,"Self-organizing computational models with specific intracortical connections can explain many functional features of visual cortex, such as topographic orientation and ocular dominance maps. However, due to their computational requirements, it is difficult to use such detailed models to study large-scale phenomenal like object segmentation and binding, object recognition, tilt illusions, optic flow, and fovea-periphery differences. This article introduces two techniques that make large simulations practical. First, we show how parameter scaling equations can be derived for laterally connected self-organizing models. These equations result in quantitatively equivalent maps over a wide range of simulation sizes, making it possible to debug small simulations and then scale them up only when needed. Parameter scaling also allows detailed comparison of biological maps and parameters between individuals and species with different brain region sizes. Second, we use parameter scaling to implement a new growing map method called GLISSOM, which dramatically reduces the memory and computational requirements of large self-organizing networks. With GLISSOM, it should be possible to simulate all of human V1 at the single-column level using current desktop workstations. We are using these techniques to develop a new simulator Topographica, which will help make it practical to perform detailed studies of large-scale phenomena in topographic maps.","James A.

To study this process, we utilized a computer-based image analysis method to quantitatively assess HIV-1 viral protein gp120 and glutamate-mediated individual neuronal damage in cultured cortical neurons. Changes in the number of neurites, arbors, branch nodes, cell body area, and average arbor lengths were determined and a database was formed (http://dm.ist.unomaha.edu/database.htm). We further proposed a two-class model of multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) to classify such HIV-1-mediated neuronal dendritic and synaptic damages. Given certain classes, including treatments with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate, gp120 or non-treatment controls from our in vitro experimental systems, we used the two-class MCLP model to determine the data patterns between classes in order to gain insight about neuronal dendritic damages. This knowledge can be applied in principle to the design and study of specific therapies for the prevention or reversal of neuronal damage associated with HAD. Finally, the MCLP method was compared with a well-known artifical neural network algorithm to test for the relative potential of different data mining applications in HAD research.","Jialin Zheng, Wei Zhuang, ...

The Anp32 family of proteins containing leucine-rich repeats,/article/10.1080/14734220410019020,"Herein we describe the characteristic features of the Anp32 family represented by the cerebellar leucine-rich repeat protein (Lanp) and the cerebellar developmental-regulated protein 1 (Cpd1). The Anp32 family consists of 32 evolutionarilyconserved proteins and is included within the superfamily of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins characterized by the presence of tandem arrays of a LRR, a structural motif implicated in the mediation of protein-protein interactions. We describe three novel human Anp32 proteins, reveal the evolutionary relationships of the members of the Anp32 family, provide insights into their biochemical and structural properties, and review their macromolecular interactions, substrate specificities, tissue distribution/expression patterns, and physiological and pathological roles. Recent findings indicate a conserved role of members of the Anp32 family during evolution in the modulation of cell signalling and transduction of gene expression to regulate the morphology and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, neural development or cerebellar morphogenesis.","Antoni Matilla, Martin Radrizzani",2005-03-01
An analytical approach to neuronal connectivity,/article/10.1140/epjb/e2005-00017-7,"This paper describes how to analytically characterize the
 connectivity of neuromorphic networks taking into account the
 morphology of their elements. By assuming that all neurons have the
 same shape and are regularly distributed along a two-dimensional
 orthogonal lattice with parameter Δ, we obtain the exact
 number of connections and cycles of any length by applying
 convolutions and the respective spectral density derived from the
 adjacency matrix. It is shown that neuronal shape plays an
 important role in defining the spatial distribution of synapses in
 neuronal networks. In addition, we observe that neuromorphic
 networks typically present an interesting property where the pattern
 of connections is progressively shifted along the spatial domain for
 increasing connection lengths. This arises from the fact that the
 axon reference point usually does not coincide with the cell center
 of mass of neurons. Morphological measurements for characterization
 of the spatial distribution of connections, including the adjacency
 matrix spectral density and the lacunarity of the connections, are
 suggested and illustrated. We also show that Hopfield networks with
 connectivity defined by different neuronal morphologies, which are
 quantified by the analytical approach proposed herein, lead to
 distinct performances for associative recall, as measured by the
 overlap index. The potential of our approach is illustrated for
 digital images of real neuronal cells.","L. da F. Costa, M. S. Barbosa",2004-12-01
The small world of the cerebral cortex,/article/10.1385/NI:2:2:145,"While much information is available on the structural connectivity of the cerebral cortex, especially in the primate, the main organizational principles of the connection patterns linking brain areas, columns and individual cells have remained elusive. We attempt to characterize a wide variety of cortical connectivity data sets using a specific set of graph theory methods. We measure global aspects of cortical graphs including the abundance of small structural motifs such as cycles, the degree of local clustering of connections and the average path length. We examine large-scale cortical connection matrices obtained from neuroanatomical data bases, as well as probabilistic connection matrices at the level of small cortical neuronal populations linked by intra-areal and interareal connections. All cortical connection matrices examined in this study exhibit “small-world” attributes, characterized by the presence of abundant clustering of connections combined with short average distances between neuronal elements. We discuss the significance of these universal organizational features of cortex in light of functional brain anatomy.

Connectivity and dynamics of neural information processing,/article/10.1385/NI:2:2:183,"In this article, we systematically review the current literature on neural connectivity and dynamics, or equivalently, structure and function. In particular, we discuss how changes in the connectivity of a neural network affect the spatiotemporal network dynamics qualitatively. The three major criteria of comparison are, first, the local dynamics at the network nodes which includes fixed point dynamics, oscillatory and chaotic dynamics; second, the presence of time delays via propagation along connecting pathways; and third, the properties of the connectivity matrix such as its statistics, symmetry, and translational invariance. Since the connection topology changes when anatomical scales are traversed, so will the corresponding network dynamics change.

“Dynamic” connectivity in neural systems,/article/10.1385/NI:2:2:205,"The study of functional interdependences between brain regions is a rapidly growing focus of neuroscience research. This endeavor has been greatly facilitated by the appearance of a number of innovative methodologies for the examination of neurophysiological and neuroimaging data. The aim of this article is to present an overview of dynamical measures of interdependence and contrast these with statistical measures that have been more widely employed. We first review the motivation, conceptual basis, and experimental approach of dynamical measures of interdependence and their application to the study of neural systems. A consideration of boot-strap “surrogate data” techniques, which facilitate hypothesis testing of dynamical measures, is then used to clarify the difference between dynamical and statistical measures of interdependence. An overview of some of the most active research areas—such as the study of the “synchronization manifold,” dynamical interdependence in neurophysiology data and the putative role of nonlinear desynchronization—is then given. We conclude by suggesting that techniques based on dynamical interdependence—or “dynamical connectivity”—show significant potential for extracting meaningful information from functional neuroimaging data.",Michael Breakspear,2004-06-01

The conceptually distinct purposes served are: (1) formulating and implementing specific hypotheses about how neuronal populations mediate a task, which will be illustrated using models of visual and auditory object processing; (2) determining how well an experimental design paradigm or analysis method works, which will be illustrated by examining event-related fMRI; (3) investigating the meaning in neural terms of macro-level concepts, which will be illustrated using functional connectivity; and (4) combining different types of macroscopic data with one another, which will be illustrated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and PET.",Barry Horwitz,2004-06-01
Inferential constraint sets in the organization of visual expectation,/article/10.1385/NI:2:2:227,"Many lines of evidence indicate that considering visual perception as a passive, stimulus-driven, feedforward decoding process is no longer tenable. Visual perceptionnaturally occurs within the context of an integrated array of ongoing cognitive processes involving memory, perception in other modalities, and motor control. In many situations, these processes allow expectations to be formed for likely visual events. This article explores the idea that the formation of visual expectations involves the active organization of visual cortical areas, providing a framework of contextual information within which expected events are interpreted. Retinal inputs are treated as constraints that feed into a complex system of interacting visual cortical areas and thalamic nuclei, which are concurrently imposing constraints on one another. Although the nature of expectational organization in the visual cortex is not well-understood, a reasonable hypothesis is that expectation involves the mutual constraint of spatiotemporal activity patterns in multiple visual cortical areas. In this scenario, expectation is instantiated by a set of activity patterns in high-level visual cortical areas that impose constraints on one another as well as on low-level areas according to the partial information that is available about expected retinal inputs. One approach to testing this proposal is through the analysis of simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from local neuronal assemblies in multiple visual cortical areas. Analysis of LFPs by multivariate autoregressive modeling is showing promise in revealing the organization of expectation in visual cortex.",Steven L. Bressler,2004-06-01
Contexts and catalysts,/article/10.1385/NI:2:2:175,"There has been a historical tension between theories of brain function emphasizing regional specialization and those focusing on integration across regions. This tension continues despite the pervasive use of functional neuroimaging, which enables testing of these theories in the human brain. There are instances of agreement, where regions thought to be critical for a given behavior (e.g., Broca’s area and language production) do become more active when a person engages in that behavior. However, a number of disconcerting results have also been found. These include activation in areas not thought to be important for the behavior, and lack of activation in regions thought to be critical for particular behaviors based on studies of the damaged brain. A recently proposed Neural Context hypothesis of brain function provides a mechanism that can reconcile these apparently disparate findings. The hypothesis states that the functional relevance of a brain area depends on the status of other connected areas—i.e., the context within which the region is operating. A region can participate in several behaviors through variations in its interactions with other areas. It is possible that certain critical nodes serve as Behavioural Catalysts, enabling the transition between behavioral states, without differential alterations in the measured activity. By virtue of its anatomical connections, an area could facilitate a shift in functional connectivity between one set of regions to another. An imaging study on the changing interregional interactions involving the hippocampus in learning and awareness serves as an example of neural context. In this case, the hippocampus may serve to catalyze the transition to awareness.",Anthony Randal McIntosh,2004-06-01
Perspectives on the estimation of effective connectivity from neuroimaging data,/article/10.1385/NI:2:2:169,"In the late 19th century, the early investigations of brain function were dominated by the concept of functional segregation. This focus was driven largely by the data available to scientists of that era. Patients with circumscribed lesions were found who were impaired in one particular ability while other abilities remained largely intact. In the first part of the 20th century, the idea of functional segregation fell into disrepute and the doctrine of “mass action” held sway, proposing that higher abilities depended on the function of the brain “as a whole.” Although seen as opposing concepts, functional integration and functional segregation are not mutually exclusive, but exist only in relation to each other. For the last decade, functional neuroimaging techniques have been used to infer functional and effective connectivity in the human brain. However, the advent of event-related fMRI experiments have apparently complicated analyses of effective connectivity because variance components induced by different events cannot be easily separated at the hemodynamic level. Only recently, a new technique, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was introduced, which provides a general framework for the analysis of effective connectivity and also allows the estimation of effective connectivity analyses in rapid event-related designs.",Christian Büchel,2004-06-01

Spatio-temporal autoregressive models defined over brain manifolds,/article/10.1385/NI:2:2:239,"Multivariate Autoregressive time series models (MAR) are an increasingly used tool for exploring functional connectivity in Neuroimaging. They provide the framework for analyzing the Granger Causality of a given brain region on others. In this article, we shall limit our attention to linear MAR models, in which a set of matrices of autoregressive coefficients A

k
 (k = 1, …, p) describe the dependence of present values of the image on lagged values of its past. Methods for estimating the A

k
 and determining which elements that are zero are well-known and are the basis for directed measures of influence. However, to date, MAR models are limited in the number of time series they can handle, forcing the a priori selection of a (small) number of voxels or regions of interest for analysis. This ignores the full spatio-temporal nature of functional brain data which are, in fact, collections of time series sampled over an underlying continuous spatial manifold—the brain. A fully spatio-temporal MAR models (ST-MAR) is developed within the framework of functional data analysis. For spatial data, each row of a matrix A

k
 is the influence field of a given voxel. A Bayesian ST-MAR model is specified in which the influence fields for all voxels are required to vary smoothly over space. This requirement is enforced by penalizing the spatial roughness of the influence fields. This roughness is calculated with a discrete version of the spatial Laplacian operator. A massive reduction in dimensionality of computations is achieved via the singular value decomposition, making an interactive exploration of the model feasible. Use of the model is illustrated with an fMRI time series that was gathered concurrently with EEG in order to analyze the origin of resting brain rhythms.",Pedro A. Valdes-Sosa,2004-06-01

We also manipulated the syntactic position (subject versus object), semantic role (agent versus patient), and order of mention (first-versus second-mentioned participant) of the probed item. Pragmatic factors (the order of mention) strongly influenced accessibility immediately and through the longest delay, whereas syntactic and semantic factors had little effect.","Sung-il Kim, Jae-ho Lee, Morton Ann Gernsbacher",2004-11-01

Prediction of the axillary lymph node status in mammary cancer on the basis of clinicopathological data and flow cytometry,/article/10.1007/BF02345205,"Axillary lymph node status is a major prognostic factor in mammary carcinoma. It is clinically desirable to predict the axillary lymph node status from data from the mammary cancer specimen. In the study, the axillary lymph node status, routine histological parameters and flow-cytometric data were retrospectively obtained from 1139 specimens of invasive mammary cancer. The ten variables: age, tumour type, tumour grade, tumour size, skin infiltration, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa, pT4 category, percentage of tumour cells in G2/M-and S-phases of the cell cycle, and ploidy index were considered as predictor variables, and the single variable lymph node metastasis pN (0 for pN0, or 1 for pN1 or pN2) was used as an output variable. A stepwise logistic regression analysis, with the axillary lymph node as a dependent variable, was used for feature selection. Only lymphangiosis carcinomatosa and tumour size proved to be significant as independent predictor variables; the other variables were non-contributory. Three paradigms with supervised learning rules (multilayer perceptron, learning vector quantisation and support vector machines) were used for the purpose of prediction. If any of these paradigms was used with the information from all ten input variables, 73% of cases could be correctly predicted, with specificity ranging from 82 to 84% and sensitivity ranging from 60 to 63%. If only the two significant input variables were used, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa and tumour diameter, the prediction accuracy was no worse. Nearly identical results were obtained by two different techniques of cross-validation (leave-one-out against ten-fold cross validation). It was concluded that: artificial neural networks can be used for risk stratification on the basis of routine data in individual cases of mammary cancer; and lymphangiosis carcinomatosa and tumour size are independent predictors of axillary lymph node metastasis in mammary cancer.","T.

Informatics approaches to functional MRI odor mapping of the rodent olfactory bulb,/article/10.1385/NI:2:1:003,"The present study applies informatics tools to aid and extend fMRI analysis of the coding mechanism of neural signals in the rodent olfactory system. Odor stimulation evokes unique spatial patterns of activity in the glomerular layer of the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB). An open-source software program, OdorMapBuilder, has been developed to process the high resolution anatomical and functional MRI images of the OB and to generate single two-dimensional flat maps, called odor maps, that describe the spatial activity patterns in the entire glomerular layer. Odor maps help identify the spatial activity patterns from the tremendous amount of fMRI data and they serve as ideal representation of space coding for the olfactory signals in the OB in response to a given odor stimulation. Based on the fMRI technology, OdorMapBuilder provides comparable odor maps on the intra-subject basis, a significant step towards the detailed analyses of the effects of odor types and/or concentrations. In addition, a new database, OdorMapDB, is developed to provide a repository for the generated odor maps. Web interfaces to the database are provided for the data entry, modification and retrieval. OdorMapDB is based on the EAV/CR (entity-attribute-value with classes and relationships) architecture and it is integrated with two other SenseLab olfactory databases: the olfactory receptor and odor databases.

Frequency-dependent selection of alternative spinal pathways with common periodic sensory input,/article/10.1007/s00422-004-0511-5,"Electrical stimulation of the lumbar cord at  distinct frequency ranges has been shown to evoke either rhythmical, step-like movements (25–50 Hz) or a sustained extension (5–15 Hz) of the paralysed lower limbs in complete spinal cord injured subjects. Frequency-dependent activation of previously “silent” spinal pathways was suggested to contribute to the differential responsiveness to distinct neuronal “codes” and the modifications in the electromyographic recordings during the actual implementation of the evoked motor tasks. In the present study we examine this suggestion by means of a simplified biology-based neuronal network. Involving two basic mechanisms, temporal summation of synaptic input and presynaptic inhibition, the model exhibits several patterns of mono- and/or oligo-synaptic motor output in response to different interstimulus intervals. It thus reproduces fundamental input–output features of the lumbar cord isolated from the brain. The results confirm frequency-dependent spinal pathway selection as a simple mechanism which enables the cord to respond to distinct neuronal codes with different motor behaviours and to control the actual performance of the latter.","Bernhard Jilge, Karen Minassian, ...

to access control",/article/10.1007/s00799-004-0078-8,"This paper presents a formal framework to represent and manage advanced policy rules, which incorporate the notions of provision and obligation. Provisions are those conditions that need to be satisfied or actions that must be performed by a user or an agent before a decision is rendered, while obligations are those conditions or actions that must be fulfilled by either the user or agent or by the system itself within a certain period of time after the decision. This paper proposes a specific formalism to express provisions and obligations within a policy and investigates a reasoning mechanism within this framework. A policy decision may be supported by more than one rule-based derivation, each associated with a potentially different set of provisions and obligations (called a global PO set). The reasoning mechanism can derive all the global PO sets for each specific policy decision and facilitates the selection of the best one based on numerical weights assigned to provisions and obligations as well as on semantic relationships among them. The formal results presented in the paper hold for many applications requiring the specification of policies, but this paper illustrates the use of the proposed policy framework in the security domain only.","Claudio Bettini, Sushil Jajodia, ...
